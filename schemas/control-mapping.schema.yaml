title: Control Mapping Schema
description: Defines the structure for mapping risks to mitigations, controls, and evidence artifacts.
type: array
items:
  type: object
  required:
    - risk_id
    - control_id
    - mitigation_description
    - implementation_status
    - evidence_url
  properties:
    risk_id:
      type: string
      description: The unique identifier of the risk being addressed (must match a risk_id from risks.yaml).
    control_id:
      type: string
      description: An identifier for the control - can be formal framework reference (NIST-800-53-RA-5) or descriptive label (Multi-model consensus process). Formal mapping to standards can be added later.
    mitigation_description:
      type: string
      description: A clear description of how the control is implemented to mitigate the identified risk, including specific technical or procedural details.
    implementation_status:
      type: string
      description: The current status of the control's implementation and operational maturity.
      enum: [Implemented, Partially Implemented, Planned, Not Applicable]
    responsible_party:
      type: string
      description: The team, role, or individual responsible for implementing and maintaining the control.
    evidence_url:
      type: string
      format: uri-reference
      description: A relative path to the evidence artifact that proves the control is implemented (e.g., evidence/reports/test-results.md, ci-logs/validation.json). Path must exist in repository.
