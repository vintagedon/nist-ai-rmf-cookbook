    - rmf_function
    - description
    - likelihood
    - impact
  properties:
    risk_id:
      type: string
      description: A unique identifier for the risk (e.g., AI-RISK-001, REPO-RISK-001).
      pattern: '^[A-Z]+-RISK-\d{3}$'
    rmf_function:
      type: string

      enum: [Govern, Map, Measure, Manage]
    description:
      type: string
      description: A clear and concise description of the risk, including context and potential consequences.
    likelihood:
      type: string
      description: The estimated likelihood of the risk occurring based on current controls and context.
      enum: [Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High]
    impact:
      type: string
      description: The estimated impact if the risk occurs, considering severity and scope of consequences.
      enum: [Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High]
    related_risks:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
        description: Risk IDs of related or dependent risks that share common causes or cascading effects.
      description: A list of other risk_ids that are related to this one through cause, effect, or mitigation dependencies.
