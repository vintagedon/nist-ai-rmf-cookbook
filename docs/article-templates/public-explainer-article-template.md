# ðŸ“‹ TEMPLATE USAGE GUIDE

## For AI Agents

This template is for public-facing explainer articles - educational content designed to help readers understand concepts, frameworks, practices, or technologies. These are NOT internal documentation or implementation guides.

### Article Purpose

Explainer articles:

- Clarify complex concepts for a defined audience
- Provide context and practical understanding
- Guide readers toward actionable knowledge
- Connect ideas to real-world applications

They do NOT:

- Document internal systems or codebases
- Provide step-by-step implementation instructions for specific tools
- Include framework compliance mappings or control IDs
- Serve as technical reference documentation

### How to Use This Template

1. Replace all `[PLACEHOLDERS]` with article-specific content
2. Read all visible ðŸ“ guidance notes - they indicate mandatory vs. optional sections
3. Adjust depth and tone based on target audience (specified in front matter)
4. Remove optional sections that don't apply to this specific article
5. Delete this entire "TEMPLATE USAGE GUIDE" section from final output

### Mandatory vs. Optional Sections

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 1. Introduction | âœ… MANDATORY | Sets context and hooks the reader |
| 2. Core Explanation | âœ… MANDATORY | The main educational content |
| 3. Why This Matters | âœ… MANDATORY | Real-world relevance and impact |
| 4. Practical Applications | âš ï¸ CONDITIONAL | Skip for purely conceptual topics |
| 5. Common Misconceptions | âš ï¸ OPTIONAL | Include if misconceptions are widespread |
| 6. Getting Started / Next Steps | âš ï¸ CONDITIONAL | Include for actionable topics |
| 7. Related Resources | âœ… MANDATORY | Further learning and context |
| 8. About This Article | âœ… MANDATORY | Metadata and versioning |

### Tone and Style Guidelines

For General Public Audience:

- Conversational but authoritative
- Minimal jargon, explain technical terms when used
- Use analogies and real-world examples
- Break complex ideas into digestible pieces

For Technical Professionals:

- More direct, assumes baseline knowledge
- Technical terminology appropriate
- Focus on nuance and edge cases
- Link to detailed technical resources

For Specific Roles (GRC, ML Engineers, etc.):

- Role-specific framing and examples
- Assume domain knowledge
- Connect to day-to-day work challenges
- Practical over theoretical

### Content Depth Indicators

Use these in your introduction to set expectations:

- Quick Read - Core concept only, 5 min read, minimal prerequisites
- Standard Explainer - Comprehensive with examples, 10-15 min, basic domain knowledge
- Deep Dive - Thorough analysis with nuance, 20+ min, significant background required
