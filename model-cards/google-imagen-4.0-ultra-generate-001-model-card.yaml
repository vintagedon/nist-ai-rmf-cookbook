# # =============================================================================
# # [EVALUATION GUIDANCE]
# # Recommendations for testing, validating, and comparing the model.
# # =============================================================================
evaluation_guidance:
  recommended_tests: |
    - Direct A/B testing against Imagen 4 and Imagen 4 Fast to quantify the quality improvement.
    - Evaluation of generated images for fine details, textures, and lighting in photorealistic scenes.
    - Cost analysis to determine if the premium price translates to a worthwhile improvement in quality for the target use case.
  key_evaluation_questions: |
    - Is the perceptible increase in quality over the standard Imagen 4 model significant enough to justify the higher cost?
    - Does the model meet the exacting standards for our professional marketing and design assets?
  comparison_considerations: |
    Compare against other top-tier, quality-focused image generation models on the market. The primary internal comparison is the cost/quality trade-off against the standard and Fast versions of Imagen 4.
