# CAPABILITIES & LIMITATIONS
# =============================================================================

capabilities:
  vendor_claimed_strengths: |
    OpenAI claims GPT-5 Chat as their "most capable model yet" with significant improvements in:
    
    Writing: "Most capable writing collaborator yet" with literary depth, rhythm, structural ambiguity handling,
    and improved everyday drafting/editing capabilities. Better at sustaining poetic forms and natural prose flow.
    
    Coding: "Strongest coding model to date" with particular improvements in complex front-end generation,
    debugging larger repositories, creating responsive websites/apps/games in one prompt, and understanding
    design aesthetics (spacing, typography, white space).
    
    Health: "Best model yet for health-related questions" scoring significantly higher on HealthBench
    evaluations. Acts as "active thought partner" for health information, flagging concerns and asking
    clarifying questions. Adapts to user context, knowledge level, and geography.
    
    Reduced Issues: "Significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following,
    and minimizing sycophancy" (sycophantic responses reduced from 14.5% to <6% in targeted evaluations).
    
    Tone Improvements: "Less effusively agreeable, fewer unnecessary emojis, more subtle and thoughtful"
    compared to GPT-4o. Designed to feel "less like talking to AI and more like chatting with a helpful
    friend with PhD-level intelligence."
    
    Real-world Utility: Emphasis on being "more useful for real-world queries" beyond benchmark performance.

  benchmark_performance: |
    Published benchmark results from OpenAI and third-party sources:
    
    - MATH (AIME 2025, no tools): 94.6% accuracy (vs GPT-4o: 42.1%)
    - SWE-bench Verified: 52.8% accuracy (coding without thinking mode)
    - HealthBench Hard: 67.2% (with thinking mode)
    - MMMU (Multimodal Understanding): 84.2% (images, video, spatial reasoning, scientific problems)
    
    OpenAI emphasizes that GPT-5 "not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions
    more quickly, but—most importantly—is more useful for real-world queries."
    
    Note: OpenAI has shifted messaging away from pure benchmark focus toward practical utility and
    user experience improvements.

  known_limitations:
    vendor_disclosed: |
      OpenAI has disclosed several limitations:
      
      - Not AGI: Explicitly stated that GPT-5 "represents a modest step toward AGI" but "lacks continuous
        self-improvement and broader cognitive autonomry"
      - Model Picker Removed: Free tier users automatically switched to mini model after usage limits,
        removing direct model selection choice
      - Rate Limits: Usage varies by tier with hard limits on free tier (10 messages/5 hours)
      - Canvas and Image Generation: "Not available with GPT-5 Pro" mode
      - Not Medical Professional Replacement: "ChatGPT does not replace a medical professional" - positioned
        as partner tool only
      - Audio/Video Inputs: Not supported in current version (text and image only)
      - Training Data Cutoff: Knowledge cutoff as of September 30, 2024
      - Safety Vulnerabilities: Research has revealed that "misspelled prompts can still elicit inappropriate
        content" despite safety improvements

    common_failure_modes: |
      Publicly reported issues and failure patterns:
      
      Tone Shift Concerns: Initial release received significant user complaints about "cold, corporate tone"
      feeling "robotic" and less spontaneous compared to GPT-4o. OpenAI released update on August 15, 2025
      to make model "warmer and friendlier."
      
      Reduced Creativity: Some users report model feels less creative or "human" than earlier models,
      particularly for creative writing and casual conversation.
      
      Increased Latency: Thinking mode introduces deliberate reasoning delays which can be problematic
      for real-time applications (e.g., contact centers requiring immediate responses).
      
      Over-Safety: Some critics note model may be overly cautious in certain domains due to safety tuning.
      
      Hallucination Reduction Not Complete: While improved, hallucinations have not been eliminated entirely.
      
      Context Limitations: Despite large context window, quality degradation may occur with very long
      conversations or complex multi-document analysis.

    unsuitable_use_cases: |
      GPT-5 Chat should NOT be used for:
      
      - Primary medical diagnosis or treatment decisions without medical professional review
      - High-stakes decisions without human oversight and validation
      - Real-time critical systems where latency is unacceptable (e.g., emergency response, automated trading)
      - Regulated domains (legal, financial, medical) as sole authority without expert verification
      - Applications requiring guaranteed factual accuracy (model can still hallucinate)
      - Tasks requiring knowledge of events after September 30, 2024 training cutoff
      - Applications where consistent personality/tone is critical (tone has shifted post-release)
      - Audio or video processing (not supported in current version)
      - Tasks requiring model to generate images (not supported in Chat version)
      - Applications requiring open-source or on-premises deployment (proprietary cloud-only)
      - Use cases requiring complete transparency of training data and model architecture

      - Do not send sensitive PII through API without additional safeguards
      - Implement data minimization (send only necessary context)
      - Review OpenAI's data processing agreements for your jurisdiction
      - Consider data residency requirements (model hosted in Microsoft/OpenAI cloud)
      - Implement separate PII detection/redaction before API calls if needed
      - Maintain separate audit trail of all data sent to OpenAI
      - Evaluate whether cloud-based processing is acceptable for your data sensitivity level

  # CHARACTERISTIC 7: Fair with Harmful Bias Managed
  fair_with_harmful_bias_managed:
    vendor_claims: |
      OpenAI states model trained on "diverse" data and with "safety fine-tuning" to reduce bias.
      RLHF process designed to align model with human values. Model "adapts to user's context,
      knowledge level, and geography" for health responses.
    
    public_evidence: |
      Limited public bias testing results:
      - No published demographic fairness evaluations or bias audits
