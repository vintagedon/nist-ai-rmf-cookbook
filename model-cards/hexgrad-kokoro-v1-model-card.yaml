    bias_mitigation: |
      The article offers multiple models; may still show bias toward English-centric models.  
    known_biases: |
      Under-representation of non-English or niche-voice TTS models.  
    assessment_notes: |
      If deploying multi-lingual or niche-voice TTS, further research required.

# # =============================================================================
# # [EVALUATION GUIDANCE]
# # Recommendations for testing, validating, and comparing the model.
# # =============================================================================
evaluation_guidance:
  recommended_tests: |
    - Use this article as a reference to shortlist candidate open-source TTS models.  
    - Map your specific use-case (i.e., voice-cloning, latency, multi-speaker dialogue) against the five axes (naturalness, voice cloning, WER, latency, parameters) defined.  
    - For each candidate model, follow up with deeper model-specific metrics, dataset provenance, license terms, hardware requirements.  
  key_evaluation_questions: |
    - Does the candidate model support your target voices / languages?  
    - Can it meet your latency/throughput requirements (e.g., real-time vs batch)?  
    - What is the voice-cloning and multi-speaker capability?  
    - Are the license and deployment costs aligned with your organization’s policy?  
  comparison_considerations: |
    - Use the table provided (e.g., Higgs Audio V2, Kokoro, Dia, Chatterbox, Orpheus, Sesame CSM) to create a shortlist and compare trade-offs. # :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
    - Consider parameter count vs latency vs quality trade-off in your target hardware environment.  
    - Recognise that while trending models may have good metrics, niche or domain-specific models may better suit your language/style requirements.

rmf_function_mapping:
  govern:
    notes: |
      Voice generation has governance implications: consent for voice-cloning, monitoring of misuse, licensing compliance.  
  map:
    context_considerations: |
      TTS model selection, voice–cloning risk, latency/quality trade-offs, open-source deployment.  
    risk_categories: ["voice_cloning_misuse", "hallucinated_audio", "latency_failure", "unintended_multi-speaker_dialogue", "license_violation"]
  measure:
    suggested_metrics: |
      - Model selection error rate (wrong voice or tone) per 1k usages  
      - Latency over threshold (e.g., >500 ms TTFB) percent of requests  
      - Word Error Rate (WER) per 1k minutes generated  
      - Unauthorized voice-clone usage incidents per 1k instances  
  manage:
    risk_management_considerations: |
      Ensure voice consent pipelines, version-control of deployed models, monitoring of generated audio, licensing checks for open-source models, fallback human review.
