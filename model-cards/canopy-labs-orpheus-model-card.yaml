    - Helps developers compare TTS models across multiple key axes (naturalness, voice cloning, WER, latency, parameters). # :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
  benchmark_performance: |
    Not applicable (not a stand-alone model)  
  special_capabilities:
    tools_support: false
    vision_support: false
    reasoning_support: true  # article includes reasoning/comparisons  
    image_generation: false
    additional_capabilities: ["TTS model landscape overview", "evaluation criteria guidance"]
  known_limitations:
    vendor_disclosed: |
      - The overview covers a selection of trending open-source TTS models on Hugging Face and may not include every relevant model. # :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
      - Does not provide full deep benchmark numbers for every model listed. # :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
    common_failure_modes: |

# # (Valid/Reliable, Safe, Secure/Resilient, Accountable/Transparent,
# # Explainable/Interpretable, Privacy-Enhanced, Fair).
# # =============================================================================
trustworthiness_assessment:
  valid_and_reliable:
    vendor_claims: |
      Article clearly states its methodology and criteria for selection. # :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
    public_evidence: |
      Article is publicly accessible and dated. # :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
    assessment_notes: |
      Serves as a good starting point for TTS model comparison, but should not replace detailed model-specific analysis.

      It’s a blog article; no direct generation risk.  
    known_safety_issues: |
      None major for consumption as reference.  
    assessment_notes: |
      Safe to use for planning and research.  
  secure_and_resilient:

    assessment_notes: |
      Good for transparency.  
  explainable_and_interpretable:

      The article explains what axes of evaluation it uses and why. # :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
    interpretability_limitations: |
      Doesn’t go into deep technical internals of each TTS model.  
    assessment_notes: |
      Acceptable for high-level planning.  
  privacy_enhanced:
    privacy_features: |
      Not applicable.  
    privacy_concerns: |
      None.  
    assessment_notes: |
      Not directly relevant for privacy.  
  fair_with_harmful_bias_managed:
    bias_mitigation: |
      Provides multiple models and multiple use-cases; however focus appears English-centric.  
    known_biases: |
      Likely under-represents non-English TTS or minority voice models. # :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
    assessment_notes: |
      Teams focusing on non-English/lower-resource languages should supplement this with additional research.

# # =============================================================================
# # [EVALUATION GUIDANCE]
# # Recommendations for testing, validating, and comparing the model.
# # =============================================================================
evaluation_guidance:
  recommended_tests: |
    - Use the article to identify candidate TTS models by comparing across the five axes defined (naturalness, voice-cloning, WER, latency, parameters). # :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
    - For each candidate, review the model’s specific documentation, benchmark results, dataset provenance and license.  
    - Match your performance/language-requirements (real-time vs batch, voice-cloning, multilingual) against model specs.  
  key_evaluation_questions: |
    - Which model supports your target language(s) and voice style?  
    - Will latency/throughput satisfy your application (e.g., interactive vs batch)?  
    - Can the model’s voice-cloning capability handle your user base or brand voice?  
    - Are license and compute cost aligned with your deployment constraints?  
  comparison_considerations: |
    - Consider trade-offs: larger parameter models may have better naturalness but higher cost and latency. The article highlights that. # :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
    - Recognise that newer or niche models may exist outside the article’s list; use it as starting guide, not exclusive list.  
    - Align with your voice/region needs: if non-English, verify support separately.

# # [NIST AI RMF MAPPING]
# # Mapping of model risks to the RMF lifecycle functions (Govern, Map,
# # Measure, Manage).
# # =============================================================================
rmf_function_mapping:
  govern:
    notes: |
      When deploying TTS models identified via such an overview, ensure version control of model, audit logs, voice consent for cloning, licensing review, monitoring of usage.  
  map:
    context_considerations: |
      TTS deployment, voice-cloning risk, multilingual audio generation, real/near-real-time voice systems.  
    risk_categories: ["voice_cloning_misuse", "hallucinated_audio", "latency_failure", "license_violation", "voice_privacy"]
  measure:
    suggested_metrics: |
      - Voice-cloning misuse incidents per 1k generated audio segments.  
      - Latency over threshold (e.g., > 500 ms start-time) % of requests.  
      - Re-transcription WER per 1k minutes generated.  
      - Multi-speaker/voice-switch error rate per 100 dialogues.  
  manage:
    risk_management_considerations: |
      Ensure audio generation consent workflows, version logging of model/voice, monitoring for drift or bias, fallback to human review for high-stakes voice use, compliance with license and regional voice-rights.
