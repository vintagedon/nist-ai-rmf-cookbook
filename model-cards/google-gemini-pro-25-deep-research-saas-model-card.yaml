intended_use:
  summary: >
    Use of Gemini Deep Research for policy intelligence gathering, compliance  research, technical implementation guidance, and strategic analysis within  astronomy-cluster operations, optimized via Negative Space Bounding (NSB)  methodology for high-signal research convergence.
  in_scope:
  - Multi-jurisdictional AI policy intelligence and weekly briefings
  - Compliance framework research and gap analysis
  - Technical implementation guidance discovery
  - Strategic planning research with bounded scope
  - Multi-framework alignment research (NIST, CIS, ISO, Colorado SB24-205)
  - Vendor technology evaluation and competitive analysis
  out_of_scope:
  - Real-time operational decisions without human review
  - Processing of CUI/ITAR/export-controlled content
  - Autonomous system configuration or deployment
  - Handling PII/PHI or regulated financial data
  - Production system changes without approval workflow
  notes: "Scope and configuration reviewed quarterly; methodology refinements ongoing."

deployment_methodology:
  optimization_framework: "Negative Space Bounding (NSB) v0.2"
  framework_purpose: >
    NSB methodology creates a two-stage collapse: (1) semantic boundaries collapse  the information retrieval space during search, (2) retrieved corpus conditions  the generative latent space for synthesis. This enables Deep Research's agentic  planning to converge on high-signal regions while maintaining autonomous discovery  of non-obvious connections.

    content_boundaries:
      description: "Semantic walls that exclude irrelevant knowledge domains"
      examples:
      - "NO think pieces without policy substance"
      - "NO product news unless tied to regulatory response"
      - "NO international policy without US operational impact"
    process_boundaries:
      description: "Constraints on reasoning architecture itself"
      examples:
      - "Bound by Recency: No sources before [date] unless essential context"
      - "Bound by Corroboration: Require 2+ sources for primary findings"
      - "Bound by Interpretation: No inferred intent without direct evidence"
