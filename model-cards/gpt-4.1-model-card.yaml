  known_limitations:
    vendor_disclosed: |
      While OpenAI emphasizes GPT-4.1's strengths, the following limitations are implicit or acknowledged:
      
      **Comparative Performance Gaps:**
      - SWE-bench performance trails Claude Opus 4 (72.5%) and Claude Sonnet 4 (72.7%) by ~18 percentage points

      - Graphwalks performance (61.7%) trails GPT-4.5 (72.3%) by 10.6 percentage points
      - Not state-of-the-art across all dimensions despite improvements
      
      **Infrastructure and Scoring Limitations:**
      - SWE-bench: 23 of 500 problems could not run on OpenAI infrastructure
      - Conservative scoring (treating infrastructure failures as 0%) reduces score from 54.6% to 52.1%
      - Performance "highly dependent on the prompts and tools used" per OpenAI documentation
      
      **Model Positioning:**
      - General-purpose model, not specialized for STEM reasoning (unlike O-series)
      - Optimized for specific use cases (coding, instruction following, long context) rather than universal excellence
      - Replaces GPT-4.5 due to better cost/performance, suggesting GPT-4.5 was not economically viable
      
      **Multimodal Limitations:**
      - Text and image input support, but no audio input
      - Text-only output (no image or audio generation)
      - Vision capabilities present but specific benchmark performance less emphasized than text/code
      
      **Knowledge Cutoff:**
      - Training data cutoff June 1, 2024
      - No real-time information access without additional tools
      - Events after June 2024 outside training knowledge

    - Can we provide human oversight for critical outputs?
    - Do we have incident response procedures?
    - Can we iterate if performance is inadequate?
    - What is our rollback plan if issues arise?

  # GOVERN: Organizational policies and oversight
  govern:
    notes: |
      **Critical Governance Challenge: Lack of System Card**
      
      GPT-4.1's absence of comprehensive safety documentation creates significant governance challenges:
      - Cannot conduct thorough risk assessment
      - Must assume risk properties based on GPT-4o/GPT-4.5
      - Difficult to establish appropriate controls without safety data
      - May not meet governance requirements for some organizations
      
      **Risk Classification (Assumed, Not Disclosed):**
      - Unknown: No Preparedness Framework evaluation published
      - Must assume similar to GPT-4.5: Medium overall risk (Medium for CBRN/Persuasion)
      - Additional risk from long context and agentic capabilities
      
      **Approval Requirements:**
      - Executive-level approval recommended given transparency gaps
      - Legal review for terms of service and data handling
      - Compliance review for privacy and regulatory requirements
      - Security review for prompt injection and adversarial robustness
      - Ethics review for bias and fairness concerns (no published evaluation)
      
      **Applicable Policies:**
      - AI risk management policy (enhanced given documentation gaps)
      - Data privacy policy (API transmission, cloud processing)
      - Information security policy (adversarial robustness, prompt injection)
      - Code deployment policy (45% SWE-bench failure rate consideration)
      - Content moderation policy (unknown safety baseline)
      - Vendor management policy (OpenAI dependency)
      - Third-party risk management (API-only, cloud processing)
      
      **Oversight Mechanisms:**
      - Enhanced monitoring given lack of safety baselines
      - Monthly safety metric review with incident tracking
      - Quarterly risk reassessment (re-evaluate as more information emerges)
      - Continuous monitoring of coding accuracy and safety
      - Regular bias and fairness audits (conduct internally)
      - Advocate for OpenAI to publish system card
      
      **Accountability Structure:**
      - Designated AI system owner (executive level recommended)
      - Risk management committee for unknown risk oversight
      - Safety incident review board
      - Ethics advisory for fairness concerns
      - Technical steering for performance and capability assessment
      - Vendor relationship manager for OpenAI engagement

    - Real-world partner validation (Blue J, Hex, Qodo)
    - Integration ecosystem (GitHub Copilot, Azure)
    
    **Partial or Limited Information:**
    - Training methodology (high-level description only)
    - Privacy protections (assumed similar to GPT-4o/GPT-4.5)
    - Performance characteristics (latency/throughput general claims)
    - Security measures (assumed standard OpenAI practices)
    
    **Critical Information Gaps:**
    - **No dedicated system card (major transparency gap)**
    - **No safety evaluation results published**
    - **No Preparedness Framework risk classification**
    - **No bias or fairness testing disclosed**
    - **No jailbreak or adversarial robustness evaluation**
    - **No hallucination rate measurement**
    - Architecture details (parameters, layers, attention specifics)
    - Training data details (datasets, sources, sizes)
    - Training compute resources
    - Red teaming results
    - Third-party safety audits
    
    **Confidence in Assessment:**
    - High confidence: Benchmark results, technical specs, pricing (well-documented)
    - Moderate confidence: Capabilities, intended use (described conceptually)
    - Low confidence: Safety properties, bias, security (limited information)
    - **No data: Risk classification, safety evaluations, fairness testing (not published)**
    
    **What Would Significantly Improve Confidence:**
    - **Publication of comprehensive system card (most critical need)**
    - Safety evaluation results (disallowed content, jailbreaks, hallucinations)
    - Preparedness Framework risk classification
    - Bias and fairness benchmarks (BBQ or equivalent)
    - Adversarial robustness testing results
    - Training data documentation
    - Privacy protection effectiveness metrics
    - Independent third-party safety audits
    - Long context-specific safety evaluation
    - Agentic use case safety controls documentation
    
    **Impact of Information Gaps:**
    - Difficult to conduct thorough pre-deployment risk assessment
    - Must make conservative assumptions about safety properties
    - Requires enhanced monitoring and testing by deployers
    - May not meet governance requirements for some organizations
    - Represents regression in OpenAI's transparency practices vs GPT-4.5

      changes: "Initial model card creation for GPT-4.1 based on OpenAI blog announcement, platform documentation, and public benchmarks. Critical note: Unlike GPT-4.5, OpenAI has not published a comprehensive system card for GPT-4.1. Safety, bias, and fairness information is largely unavailable or inferred from related models. All gaps explicitly noted as 'not disclosed', 'not published', or 'unavailable'. No information fabricated - all entries sourced or marked as absent."

# =============================================================================
# CRITICAL NOTES FOR DEPLOYERS
# =============================================================================
# This GPT-4.1 model card highlights a significant transparency gap:
# 
# MAJOR CONCERN: Unlike GPT-4.5 (which has a comprehensive 31-page system card),
# OpenAI has not published detailed safety evaluations for GPT-4.1.
#
# Missing Critical Information:
# - Safety evaluation results
# - Preparedness Framework risk classification
# - Bias and fairness testing
# - Jailbreak and adversarial robustness
# - Hallucination rates
# - Red teaming results
#
# Implications for Deployers:
# - Cannot conduct thorough pre-deployment risk assessment
# - Must assume safety properties based on GPT-4o/GPT-4.5
# - Requires enhanced monitoring and testing
# - May not meet governance requirements for some organizations
#
# Recommendations:
# - Exercise caution in high-risk applications
# - Implement comprehensive pre-deployment testing
# - Establish enhanced monitoring and controls
# - Document assumptions about safety properties
# - Advocate for OpenAI to publish comprehensive system card
# - Consider this transparency gap in deployment decisions
