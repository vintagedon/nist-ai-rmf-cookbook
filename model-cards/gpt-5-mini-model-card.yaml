  known_limitations:
    vendor_disclosed: |
      OpenAI has disclosed several limitations specific to GPT-5 mini:
      
      - Best for Well-Defined Tasks: Performance depends heavily on prompt clarity. "Rewards clarity"
        with explicit output schemas and concrete examples. Underperforms on ambiguous tasks.
      - Smaller Capacity: Not suitable for tasks requiring the deepest reasoning or most complex
        analysis - use GPT-5 main or GPT-5 Pro for those cases.
      - Training Data Cutoff: Knowledge cutoff as of May 31, 2024 (earlier than GPT-5 main)
      - Audio/Video Inputs: Not supported (text and image only)
      - Image Generation: Not supported via tools API
      - Computer Use: Not supported
      - Fine-tuning: Not supported
      - Distillation: Not supported
      
      OpenAI explicitly recommends GPT-5 mini for cost-sensitive applications with well-scoped
      requirements, not for complex open-ended reasoning or high-stakes decisions.

    common_failure_modes: |
      Publicly reported issues and failure patterns:
      
      Prompt Sensitivity: GPT-5 mini is more sensitive to prompt quality than larger models.
      Vague or ambiguous prompts lead to degraded performance. Requires "explicit framing"
      for best results.
      
      Hallucinations: While improved over earlier models, can still generate false information,
      especially when tasks exceed its capability scope. "Keep a verification step in the prompt
      and a tool call for arithmetic."
      
      Benchmark Saturation: On saturated benchmarks where all models score high, small differences
      become noise. Cost and latency become more important differentiators.
      
      Confident Errors: "Will still make confident errors if you invite them" - requires
      explicit verification prompting for critical outputs.
      
      Edge Case Handling: May struggle with unusual inputs or corner cases that would benefit
      from deeper reasoning of larger models.
      
      Complex Multi-Step Reasoning: While capable, may not match GPT-5 or GPT-5 Pro on tasks
      requiring extended reasoning chains or nuanced analysis.

    unsuitable_use_cases: |
      GPT-5 mini should NOT be used for:
      
      Task Complexity Limitations:
      - Complex, open-ended reasoning requiring deep analysis
      - High-stakes decisions without extensive human review and validation
      - Tasks requiring the absolute highest accuracy (use GPT-5 or GPT-5 Pro instead)
      - Ambiguous tasks without clear success criteria or output formats
      - Creative tasks requiring maximum model capacity and nuance
      
      Domain Restrictions:
      - Primary medical diagnosis or treatment planning (use GPT-5 with medical professional)
      - Legal advice or contract generation without lawyer review
      - Financial advice or trading decisions without validation
      - Safety-critical systems as primary controller
      
      Technical Constraints:
      - Tasks requiring knowledge after May 31, 2024 training cutoff
      - Audio or video processing (not supported)
      - Image generation tasks (not supported)
      - Computer use or automation (not supported)
      - Applications requiring on-premises deployment (cloud-only)
      
      Quality Requirements:
      - Applications where cost is not a constraint and maximum quality is required
      - Use cases where prompt engineering effort exceeds cost savings from mini
      - Tasks better served by human experts or domain-specific models
      
      When in doubt: Start with GPT-5 mini for cost-sensitive well-defined tasks; upgrade to
      GPT-5 main if quality gaps emerge; escalate to GPT-5 Pro for highest-stakes work.

  safe:
    vendor_claims: |
      OpenAI states GPT-5 mini has same safety fine-tuning as GPT-5 main, including RLHF
      training and reduced harmful outputs. Same safety controls and content filtering.
    
    public_evidence: |
      Limited independent safety evaluation specific to GPT-5 mini. Assumed to have
      similar safety posture to GPT-5 main based on shared training methodology.
      Smaller model size may affect safety in edge cases.
    
    assessment_notes: |
      Safety considerations for GPT-5 mini:

      with enterprise security. API includes rate limiting and authentication.
    
    public_evidence: |
      No security incidents reported specific to GPT-5 mini. Same cloud-hosted service
      architecture as other GPT-5 variants.
    
    assessment_notes: |
      Same security considerations as GPT-5 main:
      - Standard API security controls (key rotation, TLS, secrets management)
      - Prompt injection protections for user-facing applications
      - Monitor for adversarial attacks and abuse
      - Plan for service outages with fallback strategies
      - Assess data residency requirements (cloud-only service)

  # CHARACTERISTIC 4: Accountable and Transparent
  accountable_and_transparent:
    vendor_claims: |
      OpenAI provides API documentation, pricing transparency, and model behavior examples.

      No specific bias testing results disclosed for mini variant.
    
    public_evidence: |
      No published bias evaluations specific to GPT-5 mini. Assumed to inherit bias patterns
      from GPT-5 main training, but smaller model size may affect bias differently.
    
    assessment_notes: |
      Bias management requires deployment-level controls:
      - Conduct domain-specific bias testing for your population
      - Test performance across demographic groups
      - Monitor for disparate impact in production
      - Implement bias detection at application level

usage_notes: |
  This model card follows NIST AI RMF principles with specific focus on cost-performance
  trade-offs for OpenAI's GPT-5 mini model.
  
  Key Characteristics of GPT-5 mini:
  - Cost-optimized variant: 5x cheaper than GPT-5 main ($0.25-$2 vs $1.25-$10 per 1M tokens)
  - Performance: Similar to GPT-5 on well-defined tasks, ~5-10% gap on complex tasks
  - Speed: Faster than GPT-5 main, especially with minimal/low reasoning effort
  - Prompt-sensitive: Requires explicit schemas and examples for best performance
  - Large context: 400k tokens (same as GPT-5 main)
  - Training cutoff: May 31, 2024 (earlier than GPT-5 main)
  
  When to Choose GPT-5 mini:
  ✅ Cost-sensitive high-volume applications
  ✅ Well-defined tasks with clear success criteria
  ✅ Strong prompt engineering capability on your team
  ✅ Can provide explicit output schemas and examples
  ✅ Error tolerance acceptable for use case
  ✅ Speed and throughput are priorities
  
  When to Choose GPT-5 main Instead:
  ❌ Complex, open-ended reasoning required
  ❌ Maximum quality is non-negotiable
  ❌ High-stakes decisions without extensive validation
  ❌ Limited prompt engineering resources
  ❌ Tasks require knowledge after May 31, 2024
  ❌ Cost is not a primary constraint
  
  Critical Success Factors:
  1. Invest in prompt engineering - quality depends on prompt clarity
  2. Use explicit output schemas and concrete examples
  3. Include verification steps in prompts
  4. Test extensively on your data before production
  5. Monitor quality continuously and compare to GPT-5 main
  6. Plan upgrade path to main if quality gaps emerge
  
  Cost-Benefit Decision Framework:
  - Calculate: (5x cost savings) - (prompt engineering cost) - (quality gap impact)
  - If positive at scale: Use GPT-5 mini
  - If negative or marginal: Use GPT-5 main
  - If uncertain: Run A/B test with real traffic
  
  This card should be updated as:
  - New benchmark results become available
  - OpenAI publishes mini-specific guidance
  - Production deployments reveal cost-quality patterns
  - Model updates or version changes occur
