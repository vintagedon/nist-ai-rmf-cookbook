    This model card was compiled from the following sources:
    
    Primary Sources:
    - OpenAI official documentation at platform.openai.com
    - OpenAI announcement blog post (April 14, 2025)
    - OpenAI Usage Policies, Terms of Use, and Service Terms
    - OpenAI Safety Evaluations Hub (referenced in secondary sources)
    
    Secondary Sources:
    - Third-party API providers: LangDB, OpenRouter, AI/ML API
    - Independent analyses: DataCamp, VentureBeat, RD World Online
    - Developer platforms: GitHub Models documentation
    - Tech news coverage: gHacks, SmythOS
    - Academic/research sources: Promptfoo benchmark comparisons
    
    Information Limitations:
    - No direct access to OpenAI's formal model card or safety report
    - Technical details (parameters, architecture) not publicly disclosed
    - Training data details not publicly disclosed
    - Relied on third-party monitoring for some performance metrics
    - Information gathered October 28, 2025; model released April 14, 2025

  completeness_assessment: |
    Assessment of information completeness by section:
    
    Comprehensive Information:
    - Model identity and basic specifications (release date, context window, pricing)
    - Benchmark performance scores (multiple sources corroborating)
    - Capabilities and intended use cases (well-documented by OpenAI)
    - Licensing and usage policies (clearly documented)
    - API specifications and integration details
    
    Partial Information:
    - Safety measures and testing (high-level approach disclosed, limited detail)
    - Performance characteristics (third-party monitoring, not official OpenAI data)
    - Known limitations (some disclosed, likely incomplete)
    - Comparison with alternatives (publicly available but not comprehensive)
    - Trustworthiness assessment (based on available evidence, not exhaustive testing)
    
    Critical Gaps:
    - Training data composition, sources, and sizes (not disclosed)
    - Parameter count and detailed architecture (proprietary)
    - Specific bias testing methodology and detailed results (not disclosed)
    - Detailed safety training approaches (high-level only)
    - Formal "model card" or comprehensive safety report (not published)
    - Long-term model behavior and stability (recent release)
    - Independent third-party safety audits (not publicly available)
    
    What Would Improve Confidence:
    - Official OpenAI model card with standardized disclosures
    - Comprehensive safety report with detailed testing methodology
    - Independent third-party safety and bias audits
    - More transparency on training data and architecture
    - Longer track record of production use and issue reports
    - Published case studies from enterprise deployments
    - Academic research papers analyzing model behavior
    - Comparative benchmarking by independent organizations
    
    Overall Assessment:
    Information is sufficient for initial deployment evaluation in most use cases, but
    significant transparency gaps exist. Organizations requiring high transparency
    (e.g., regulated industries, high-stakes applications) should carefully consider
    whether available information meets their governance requirements. The card provides
    actionable guidance based on available information, but deployers should conduct
    their own testing and validation before production use.
