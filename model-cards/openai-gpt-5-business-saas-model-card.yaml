intended_use:
  summary: >
    Use of ChatGPT Business to assist with AI governance documentation, controlled
    repository automation plans, and non-sensitive technical writing within the
    NIST AI RMF Cookbook project during Phase 0.2.
  in_scope:
  - Drafting and refining governance and documentation artifacts
  - Generating structured templates and skeletons for repo content
  - Non-sensitive technical explanation and summarization
  out_of_scope:
  - Processing client/customer/government data or CUI
  - Production system changes or autonomous decision-making
  - Handling PII/PHI or regulated financial data
  notes: "This scope will be revisited at ≥ Phase 0.3 as governance matures."

  coverage: ["GOVERN"]
  notes: >
    At Phase 0.2 this card records governance intent, roles, boundaries, and
    configuration. MAP/MEASURE/MANAGE will be added in later phases when
    operational data and procedures exist.

disclosures:
  limitations:
  - "This card focuses on the managed service context; model internals are referenced."
  - "Evaluation metrics and red-team findings are intentionally out of scope in Phase 0.2."
  assumptions:
  - "Service features remain within Phase 0.2 defaults unless a board-approved PR changes them."
  dependencies:
  - "Availability and terms of ChatGPT Business (OpenAI)"
  - "Sibling GPT-5 model card for underlying model details"
