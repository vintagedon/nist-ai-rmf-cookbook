capabilities:
  vendor_claimed_strengths: |
    Google's best text-to-image model, performing well in photorealistic composition with improved spelling, typography, and instruction following. Produces richer colors, textures, and details compared to previous versions. [28] Supports long and complex prompts. [29]
  benchmark_performance: |
    Scored high on human evaluations on GenAI-Bench, with one of the highest Elo scores for overall preference compared to other models. "Overall preference" measures the fulfillment of the user's intent. [28]
  special_capabilities:

    - "synthid_watermarking"
  known_limitations:
    vendor_disclosed: |
      Tasks requiring numerical reasoning (e.g., generating an exact number of objects) are challenging. Prompts involving reasoning about scale, complex compositional phrases (e.g., "one red hat and a black glass book"), and actions are the hardest across all models. [28]
    common_failure_modes: |
      Difficulty with spatial reasoning and complex language prompts.
    unsuitable_use_cases: |
      Creating deceptive or harmful imagery; impersonating individuals without consent.
# # =============================================================================
# # [TRAINING & DATA]
# # Information on the data and methodology used to train the model.
# # =============================================================================
training_information:
  training_data_description: |
    Trained on a large dataset of images, text, and associated annotations. Synthetic captions were generated using Gemini models to help the model learn small details. [28]
  training_methodology: |
    Trained using JAX on Google TPU hardware. The multi-stage data filtering process included removal of unsafe/low-quality images, removal of AI-generated images, deduplication, and filtering of captions for unsafe content or PII. [28]
  data_privacy_considerations: |
    Post-training mitigations include tools such as SynthID watermarking to reduce risks like misinformation. [28]
# # =============================================================================
# # [INTENDED USE & SCOPE]
# # Guidance on suitable, unsuitable, and out-of-scope applications.
# # =============================================================================
intended_use:
  vendor_intended_use: |
    To generate high-quality, high-resolution images in a wide range of visual styles for creative and commercial applications. [28]
  suitable_domains:
  - "digital_marketing"
  - "advertising"
  - "media_production"
  - "content_creation"
  out_of_scope_use: |
    Any use that violates Google's safety and acceptable use policies.
# # =============================================================================
# # [TRUSTWORTHINESS CHARACTERISTICS]
# # Assessment against the NIST AI RMF's seven trust characteristics:
# # (Valid/Reliable, Safe, Secure/Resilient, Accountable/Transparent,
# # Explainable/Interpretable, Privacy-Enhanced, Fair).

    bias_mitigation: |
      Subject to Google's internal bias mitigation processes, including data filtering and safety evaluations.
    known_biases: |
      May reproduce biases present in the training data.
    assessment_notes: |
      Requires careful prompt design and output review to manage potential biases.
# # =============================================================================
# # [EVALUATION GUIDANCE]
# # Recommendations for testing, validating, and comparing the model.
# # =============================================================================
evaluation_guidance:
  recommended_tests: |
    - Test prompt adherence with long, complex, and compositional prompts.
    - Evaluate the quality and legibility of generated text and typography.
    - Assess the photorealism and detail level for marketing and creative content.
    - Verify the presence and robustness of the SynthID watermark in generated assets.
  key_evaluation_questions: |
    - Does the model's ability to follow complex instructions reduce the need for prompt engineering and iteration?
    - Is the quality of rendered text sufficient for our branding and design needs?
  comparison_considerations: |
    Compare against its own variants (Fast, Ultra) and other leading text-to-image models on quality, speed, cost, and unique features like typography.
