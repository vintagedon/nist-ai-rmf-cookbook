      - Text outputs are human-readable (surface-level interpretability)
      - Can be prompted to explain visual reasoning (chain-of-thought for vision)
      - Can describe what it "sees" in images
      - Attention mechanisms theoretically analyzable (not practical at scale)
      
      Vision-specific explainability:
      - Visual grounding capability (can identify regions/objects it's describing)
      - Can generate descriptions of visual reasoning process
      - Can explain what visual features inform its conclusions
      
      Explainability limitations:
      - Black-box neural network: Internal decision process not transparent
      - 10.67B parameters: Too complex for human understanding of weights
      - Vision-text cross-attention: Multimodal reasoning even less interpretable
      - Emergent behavior: Capabilities arise from training, not explicit programming
      - Post-hoc explanations: Model-generated explanations may be unreliable or fabricated
      
      No built-in explainability features:
      - No attention visualization tools provided
      - No confidence scores for visual interpretations
      - No uncertainty quantification
      - No causal tracing capabilities for vision decisions
      - No guaranteed accurate self-explanation of visual reasoning

    interpretability_challenges: |
      Fundamental challenges:
      - Scale: 10.67B parameters beyond human comprehension
      - Multimodal complexity: Vision-text alignment adds opacity
      - Distributed representations: Visual knowledge encoded across network
      - Non-linear: Complex non-linear transformations obscure reasoning
      - Cross-attention: Vision-text interaction difficult to interpret
      - Stochastic: Sampling introduces randomness
      
      Vision-specific challenges:
      - Cannot definitively explain why it "sees" specific things in images
      - Visual reasoning process opaque
      - Attention on image regions doesn't fully explain interpretations
      - Facial recognition process (even if mitigated) not explainable
      - OCR decisions and text extraction reasoning unclear
      
      Practical limitations:
      - Cannot definitively explain any specific visual interpretation
      - Post-hoc visual explanations may be fabricated or rationalized
      - Debugging visual failure modes requires extensive testing
      - Multi-modal reasoning especially difficult to trace

    assessment_notes: |
      Explainability strategies:
      - Use chain-of-thought prompting for visual reasoning tasks
      - Request visual grounding (identify specific regions/objects)
      - Implement output validation independent of model explanations
      - Don't rely on model-generated visual explanations for high-stakes decisions
      - Use multiple prompts to test consistency of visual interpretations
      - Consider ensemble approaches for critical visual applications
      - Test with images that have known ground truth
      
      Regulatory considerations:
      - May not satisfy explainability requirements for regulated vision domains
      - Human oversight essential for decisions requiring visual explanation
      - Document known limitations in visual interpretability
      - Maintain audit trails separate from model outputs
      - Image inputs create additional explainability challenges
      
      Not suitable for:
      - Applications requiring legally defensible visual interpretations
      - Regulated decisions with "right to explanation" requirements (medical, legal)
      - Critical systems where visual failure modes must be understood
      - Safety-critical vision applications (autonomous vehicles, medical imaging)

      - Images may be stored by API providers
      - Self-hosting provides full control over image data
      - No built-in privacy-preserving inference techniques
      - Context window (128K) may expose significant user data
      - Image inputs create substantial privacy exposure
      
      Vision-specific data handling concerns:
      - Images persist in context window for conversation duration
      - OCR extracts text that may contain PII
      - Facial features processed even if identification mitigated
      - Document images may contain sensitive business information

    assessment_notes: |
      Privacy deployment requirements:
      - Implement strict image input policies (no faces without consent)
      - Redact PII from images before model interaction if possible
      - Use self-hosting for sensitive image applications
      - Review API provider privacy policies carefully (especially image handling)
      - Implement image retention policies (automatic deletion after processing)
      - Consider edge/local deployment for privacy-critical applications
      - Test for training data memorization (visual and text)
      - Implement facial detection and blurring if needed
      - OCR PII detection and redaction before processing
      
      High-risk privacy scenarios:

      - Legal: Privileged documents and communications
      - Government: Classified or sensitive information
      - Personal photos: Faces and identifying information
      - Identity documents: Passports, licenses, IDs
      
      Privacy testing priorities:
      1. Facial identification testing (verify mitigations)
      2. PII extraction from document images
      3. Image memorization testing (prompt for known training images)
      4. OCR PII extraction testing
      5. Context window data handling validation
      6. Image logging and retention policy review
      7. Image data deletion capability verification
      8. Compliance validation (GDPR, HIPAA, BIPA, etc.)
      
      CRITICAL: Vision models have fundamentally different privacy profile than
      text-only models. Image inputs create substantial privacy exposure.
