intended_use:
  summary: >
    Use of Google Code Assist Standard across all engineer accounts for repository  automation, infrastructure code generation, database optimization, and development  assistance within astronomy-cluster operations. Provisioned via Google Developer  Program Premium with enterprise data governance and IP indemnification.
  in_scope:
  - Repository automation (commit messages, documentation generation)
  - Infrastructure code generation and assistance (Proxmox, Kubernetes, automation)
  - Database query generation and optimization
  - Code review assistance and refactoring suggestions
  - Documentation generation from code
  - Integration with Workspace, CLI (Gemini CLI), and GCP services
  - Firebase development assistance
  - Colab Enterprise integration
  - Cloud Run deployment assistance
  out_of_scope:
  - Autonomous code deployment without review
  - Processing credentials, API keys, or secrets
  - Production system changes without approval workflow
  - Code generation for security-critical functions without review
  notes: "Enterprise tier features (custom grounding) available but not currently deployed."
