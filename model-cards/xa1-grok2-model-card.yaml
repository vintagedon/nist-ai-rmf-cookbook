technical_specifications:
  architecture:
    base_architecture: "Dense Transformer (multimodal-enabled variant)"
    parameter_count: "Undisclosed (estimated 250–350B)"
    context_window: "128 K tokens (expandable to 256 K for enterprise endpoints)"

    architectural_details: |
      Grok-2 is xAI’s second-generation frontier-scale model, trained with multi-stage reinforcement 
      and retrieval grounding.  
      It incorporates an updated transformer architecture with long-context memory optimization, 
      adaptive positional embeddings, and safety alignment influenced by open-weight research from LLaMA 3 
      and Gemini 1.5 families.  
      Grok-2 supports multimodal embeddings (text, code, limited image metadata) but is deployed text-first 
      in production through X (Twitter) and xAI Cloud.
  modalities:
    supported_inputs: ["text", "structured_metadata"]
    supported_outputs: ["text"]
  performance_characteristics:
    speed_tier: "Medium"
    cost_tier: "High (API / X Premium+)"
    latency: |
      Typical: 1.5–2.5 s per 1 K tokens under hosted inference.  
      Enterprise API offers streaming mode and parallel context pipelines.
    throughput: |
      Designed for conversational workloads and large-context summarization in social and enterprise settings.

  vendor_claimed_strengths: |
    • Context-aware conversation and retrieval-grounded reasoning.  
    • Integrates with live X platform data streams for factual synthesis.  
    • Excels in summarizing threads, drafting content, and long-form reasoning.  
    • Alignment tuned for wit, brevity, and factuality over creative elaboration.
  benchmark_performance: |
    - MMLU: 88.9  
    - GSM8K: 93.4  
    - HumanEval: 83.5  
    - TruthfulQA: 90.1

    (xAI internal and ARC 2024–2025 third-party tests)
  special_capabilities:
    tools_support: true
    vision_support: limited
    reasoning_support: true
    image_generation: false
    additional_capabilities: ["real_time_retrieval", "structured_reasoning", "social_data_summarization", "context_persistence"]
  known_limitations:
    vendor_disclosed: |
      Image understanding limited to caption and metadata parsing; 
      not a full multimodal model.  
      Factual reliability depends on retrieval freshness and source credibility.  
      Distinct personality tuning ("Grok style") may yield informal tone.
    common_failure_modes: |
      Occasional sarcasm or humor misinterpretation; factual drift when retrieval disabled.  
      Long reasoning chains occasionally truncated under streaming mode.
    unsuitable_use_cases: |
      Regulatory, legal, or medical automation; environments requiring deterministic reasoning logs.

# # =============================================================================
# # [TRAINING & DATA]
# # Information on the data and methodology used to train the model.
# # =============================================================================
training_information:
  training_data_description: |
    Mixed corpus including public web, open academic data, open-license code, and curated X/Twitter datasets.  
    Fine-tuning integrates structured social graph and news corpora for temporal awareness.  
    Synthetic reinforcement data used for reasoning depth and tone alignment.
  training_methodology: |
    Two-phase training: large-scale autoregressive pretraining followed by reinforcement 
    with human feedback (RLHF) and "Retrieval-Grounded RL" for factual consistency.  
    Alignment targeted for personality, humor, and correctness balance.
  data_privacy_considerations: |
    X/Twitter user data used only in aggregated, anonymized form.  
    No personal messages or private data included in pretraining.  
    Enterprise APIs provide isolation and retention control.

# # =============================================================================
# # [TRUSTWORTHINESS CHARACTERISTICS]
# # Assessment against the NIST AI RMF's seven trust characteristics:
# # (Valid/Reliable, Safe, Secure/Resilient, Accountable/Transparent,
# # Explainable/Interpretable, Privacy-Enhanced, Fair).
# # =============================================================================
trustworthiness_assessment:
  valid_and_reliable:
    vendor_claims: |
      Consistent factual recall and temporal reasoning; enhanced grounding from live data integration.
