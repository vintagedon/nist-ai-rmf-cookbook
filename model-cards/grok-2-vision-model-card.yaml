# EVALUATION GUIDANCE
# =============================================================================

evaluation_guidance:
  recommended_tests: |
    Given limited vendor documentation, comprehensive pre-deployment testing is CRITICAL:
    
    1. Safety & Content Filtering:
       - Test with adversarial prompts for harmful content generation
       - Verify refusal behavior on sensitive topics
       - Assess overrefusal rate on benign prompts
       - Test jailbreak resistance with domain-specific attacks
    
    2. Vision Capability Validation:
       - Test document understanding accuracy on your document types
       - Validate chart/diagram interpretation for your use cases
       - Assess screenshot analysis quality
       - Test photograph understanding capabilities
       - Verify performance on your image quality/format requirements
    
    3. Accuracy & Hallucination:
       - Extensive fact-checking on domain-specific queries
       - Test with questions where incorrect answers could cause harm
       - Validate visual understanding accuracy (do descriptions match images?)
       - Test for visual hallucinations (claiming to see things not in image)
    
    4. Bias & Fairness:
       - Test with diverse demographic representations in images
       - Assess performance across multiple languages
       - Test for stereotyping in image descriptions
       - Validate equal performance across demographic groups
    
    5. Privacy & Person Identification:
       - Test whether model refuses to identify people from photos
       - Assess PII handling in image content
       - Verify appropriate handling of sensitive visual information
    
    6. Function Calling / Tool Use:
       - Validate tool calling accuracy for your integration
       - Test structured output reliability
       - Verify JSON schema compliance
    
    7. Reliability & Performance:
       - Measure latency for your use case
       - Test throughput under load
       - Assess consistency across repeated queries
       - Validate context window handling (up to 32,768 tokens)
    
    8. Multimodal Integration:
       - Test combined text + image understanding
       - Validate handling of multiple images
       - Assess quality degradation with complex multimodal inputs
    
    Given transparency gaps, BASELINE ALL METRICS - you cannot compare to published vendor 
    benchmarks since they don't exist for most capabilities.

  comparison_considerations: |
    Comparing to other multimodal models:
    
    Grok 2 Vision vs. GPT-4 Vision / GPT-4o:
    - OpenAI provides comprehensive system cards, safety evaluations, and benchmarks
    - GPT-4V has extensive third-party testing and community knowledge
    - Documentation gap makes capability comparison difficult
    
    Grok 2 Vision vs. Claude 3 Sonnet/Opus with vision:
    - Anthropic provides detailed system cards and safety evaluations
    - Claude has published fairness and bias testing
    - Anthropic's transparency substantially higher
    
    Grok 2 Vision vs. Gemini Pro Vision / Gemini 1.5:
    - Google provides technical reports and benchmark results
    - Gemini has published safety evaluations
    - Larger context window available in Gemini 1.5
    
    Grok 2 Vision vs. open source alternatives (LLaVA, CogVLM):
    - Open source models have published architectures and training details
    - Community testing more extensive for popular open models
    - Transparency substantially higher even if capability lower
    
    Key Trade-offs:
    - Documentation vs. Capability: Choose Grok 2 Vision only if capabilities justify accepting 
      documentation gaps
    - Cost: Compare $2/$10 per million tokens to alternatives
    - Ecosystem: Consider xAI integration value vs. safety documentation
    - Risk Tolerance: Low-stakes use cases may accept gaps; high-stakes should prefer documented models
    
    RECOMMENDATION: For high-stakes deployments requiring safety assurance, bias testing, and 
    comprehensive documentation, consider alternatives with published system cards and safety 
    evaluations. For exploratory or low-stakes uses where xAI integration valuable, Grok 2 Vision 
    may be appropriate with extensive internal testing.

  # GOVERN: Organizational policies and oversight
  govern:
    notes: |
      Governance considerations for Grok 2 Vision deployment:
      
      ELEVATED RISK POSTURE REQUIRED:
      Given lack of vendor documentation, governance must be MORE stringent than for well-documented 
      models:
      
      Policy Requirements:
      - Require executive approval for production deployment given documentation gaps
      - Establish enhanced monitoring requirements
      - Define clear escalation for safety incidents without vendor guidance
      - Document risk acceptance for transparency gaps
      - Require regular re-evaluation (quarterly minimum)
      
      Oversight Structure:
      - Designated risk owner for deployment
      - Enhanced incident response team
      - Regular review of model behavior for drift or issues
      - External expert consultation consideration
      
      Documentation Requirements:
      - Comprehensive internal testing documentation
      - Baseline metrics establishment
      - Incident log with detailed tracking
      - Decision rationale for choosing under-documented model
      
      Risk Acceptance:
      - Formal documentation of known unknown risks
      - Explicit approval of transparency gaps
      - Defined use case boundaries (likely narrower than well-documented models)
      - Regular governance review to reassess risk tolerance

  # MAP: Context and risk identification
  map:
    context_considerations: |
      CRITICAL: Context considerations MORE important given documentation gaps:
      
      Use Case Context:
      - Limit initial deployment to LOW-STAKES use cases
      - Avoid high-stakes decisions without extensive validation
      - Consider pilot/experimental status until sufficient testing completed
      - Plan for human-in-the-loop for all outputs initially
      
      Data Sensitivity:
      - Unknown training data sourcing creates privacy uncertainty
      - Image content privacy particularly concerning (person identification behavior unknown)
      - Consider whether proprietary or sensitive images should be sent to model
      - Evaluate data retention and access policies from xAI
      
      Stakeholder Impacts:
      - Who is affected by model errors?
      - Can we detect and correct errors before stakeholder harm?
      - Are affected populations aware of AI use?
      - Do we have recourse mechanisms for failures?
      
      Regulatory Requirements:
      - Can we meet transparency requirements without vendor documentation?
      - Do we have sufficient information for required AI disclosures?
      - Can we comply with bias and fairness regulations without testing data?
      - Are we meeting duty of care without safety evaluations?
      
      Competitive/Strategic Context:
      - Is early access worth accepting documentation risk?
      - Do we have resources for extensive internal validation?
      - Can we switch to alternatives if issues arise?

    risk_categories:
      - "UNKNOWN RISKS: Safety controls unknown - harmful content generation potential unclear"
      - "UNKNOWN RISKS: Training data unknown - copyright, privacy, bias sources unclear"
      - "UNKNOWN RISKS: Adversarial robustness unknown - jailbreak vulnerability unclear"
      - "UNKNOWN RISKS: Fairness unknown - demographic performance gaps unknown"
      - "Vision-specific: Person identification behavior unknown"
      - "Vision-specific: Visual hallucination rates unknown"
      - "Vision-specific: Image privacy handling unknown"
      - "Reliability: Hallucination rates unknown"
      - "Reliability: Consistency and robustness unknown"
      - "Operational: Limited documentation for troubleshooting"
      - "Compliance: Insufficient documentation for regulatory requirements"

  # MEASURE: Metrics and monitoring
  measure:
    suggested_metrics: |
      ENHANCED MONITORING REQUIRED due to documentation gaps:
      
      Pre-deployment Baseline Establishment (MANDATORY):
      Since vendor provides no benchmarks, YOU must establish baselines:
      - Safety refusal rate on adversarial test set (create domain-specific tests)
      - Hallucination rate on ground truth dataset (vision + text)
      - Visual understanding accuracy on labeled test set
      - Bias metrics across demographic test sets
      - Person identification behavior (should refuse)
      - Overrefusal rate on benign prompts
      - Latency and throughput on representative workload
      
      Continuous Production Monitoring (ELEVATED VIGILANCE):
      - Harmful content generation rate (human review sample + automated)
      - Hallucination reports (user feedback + automated detection)
      - Visual hallucination incidents (claiming to see things not present)
      - Privacy incidents (PII leakage, inappropriate person identification)
      - Bias complaints or demographic performance gaps
      - Tool calling accuracy / structured output correctness
      - Error rates and failure modes
      - User satisfaction and trust metrics
      
      Behavioral Monitoring:
      - Model behavior drift detection (compare to baseline)

      - Regular sharing within organization
      - Consider publishing learnings (help community)
      
      SPECIFIC GROK 2 VISION RISKS TO MANAGE:
      
      Unknown Safety Controls:
      - Assume minimal safety training until proven otherwise
      - Implement multi-layer external filtering
      - Regular adversarial testing
      - Rapid response plan for harmful content
      
      Unknown Training Data:
      - Assume potential copyright/privacy issues
      - Don't rely on model for legal/compliance claims
      - Monitor for memorization or data leakage
      - Be prepared for controversy
      
      Vision Privacy:
      - Test person identification behavior extensively
      - Implement external person detection and blurring if needed
      - Conservative policies on image content
      - Clear user consent for image processing
      
      Documentation Gaps:
      - Build internal documentation as you learn
      - Share learnings across team
      - Track vendor updates
      - Be prepared to switch models if needed
      
      EXIT STRATEGY:
      - Plan for migration to alternative with better documentation
      - Avoid deep dependency until documentation improves
      - Regular evaluation of documented alternatives
      - Clear criteria for when to switch

    Primary sources: 
    - xAI documentation snapshot (PDF provided by user)
    - xAI documentation website (docs.x.ai)
    - Web search results for supplementary information
    
    CRITICAL LIMITATION: No comprehensive system card, safety evaluation documentation, or 
    detailed technical specifications available from xAI. This model card is based on LIMITED 
    publicly available information and contains substantially more "not listed at source" entries 
    than typical model cards for comparable models from other vendors.
    
    Information quality: PARTIAL - basic specifications available but critical safety, fairness, 
    training, and evaluation information not accessible.

  completeness_assessment: |
    Minimal: Basic specifications (context window, pricing, modalities, aliases)
    
    Not Available: 
    - Comprehensive safety evaluations
    - Bias and fairness testing
    - Training data details
    - Training methodology
    - Architecture specifications
    - Parameter count
    - Benchmark results (from vendor)
    - Usage policies
    - Known limitations and failure modes
    - Privacy protections
    - Explainability features
    - Third-party audits or red team results
    
    COMPLETENESS RATING: 15-20%
    
    This represents SUBSTANTIALLY LESS transparency than industry leaders (OpenAI, Anthropic, 
    Google, Meta) provide for comparable models. Organizations should be aware that deploying 
    this model requires accepting significant information gaps and conducting extensive internal 
    testing to establish baselines and safety properties that would typically be documented by 
    the vendor.
    
    Would critically improve confidence:
    - Published system card with safety evaluations
    - Bias and fairness testing results
    - Training data transparency
    - Benchmark results from vendor
    - Third-party safety audits
    - Red team evaluation results
    - Usage policy documentation
    - Known limitations documentation
    - Incident response guidance
