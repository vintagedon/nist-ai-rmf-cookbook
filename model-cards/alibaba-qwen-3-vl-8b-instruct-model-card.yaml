  vendor_claimed_strengths: |

    - Text understanding comparable to pure-text LLMs with vision fused seamlessly. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

  benchmark_performance: |
    While precise public benchmark values are limited, third-party summary reports highlight strong reliability and high performance across multimodal tasks. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}

  special_capabilities:
    tools_support: true (via visual agent/tool invocation)
    vision_support: true
    reasoning_support: true
    image_generation: false
    additional_capabilities: ["image + video understanding", "tool invocation from visuals", "long-document & long-video reasoning"]

  known_limitations:
    vendor_disclosed: |
      Training data detailed breakdown not public; inference cost remains significant for large context/video.
    common_failure_modes: |
      - In extremely long or complex video/document chains, performance may degrade.
      - Hardware/VRAM constraints may limit throughput or real-time responsiveness.
    unsuitable_use_cases: |
      - Real-time systems with tight latency requirements on low-end hardware without adaptation.
      - Regulated domains requiring full transparency of training/data provenance unless further audit is done.

training_information:
  training_data_description: |
    The model card describes “broader, higher-quality pre-training” but does not detail dataset size, sources, or filtering pipelines. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}
  training_methodology: |
    Likely large-scale multimodal pre-training (text/images/videos) followed by instruction-tuning for the Instruct variant.
  data_privacy_considerations: |
    No explicit statement on PII filtering or dataset provenance; users should conduct risk assessments for sensitive use-cases.

intended_use:
  vendor_intended_use: |
    Unified vision-language assistant tasks: reading images/videos+text, reasoning, tool invocation, interactive multimodal workflows.
  suitable_domains: ["multimodal assistant", "document & video analysis", "vision-based agent workflows", "OCR + long-document processing"]
  out_of_scope_use: |
    - Single-modality generation-only tasks where simpler models suffice.
    - Low-end hardware deployments without adaptation/fine-tuning.
    - Uses requiring full training provenance and audit trail unless supplemented.

trustworthiness_assessment:
  valid_and_reliable:
    vendor_claims: |
      Descriptions of architecture and capabilities publicly available.
    public_evidence: |
      Model card page and press articles present features; independent benchmark detail still limited.
    assessment_notes: |
      Strong candidate for multimodal tasks; still advisable to validate in-domain especially for long-context/video workflows.

  safe:
    safety_measures: |
      Apache 2.0 license; open release signals broader transparency.
    known_safety_issues: |
      Hallucinations possible especially in complex multimodal reasoning; large context windows may amplify drift.
    assessment_notes: |
      Deploy with human-in-loop review, especially for high-stakes applications.

  secure_and_resilient:
    security_features: |
      Open weights support on-premise deployment, improving auditability and control.
    known_vulnerabilities: |
      Large compute/memory requirements may surface resource exhaustion risks if mis-deployed.
    assessment_notes: |
      Ensure infrastructure controls, quotas, monitoring of usage.

  accountable_and_transparent:
    transparency_level: "Medium-High"
    auditability: |
      Model weights and code are public; dataset provenance still limited.
    assessment_notes: |
      For regulated use where audit is critical, complement with dataset disclosure or additional evaluation.

  explainable_and_interpretable:
    explainability_features: |
      Outputs (text) are inspectable; architecture details partially exposed.
    interpretability_limitations: |
      Internal reasoning and multi-modal fusion steps remain opaque.
    assessment_notes: |
      Suitable for many tasks; for interpretability-heavy domains consider layering logging/trace.

  privacy_enhanced:
    privacy_features: |
      On-premise deployment possible; multimodal fusion supports controlled contexts.
    privacy_concerns: |
      Unknown training data provenance may include PII; large context windows may cause unintended memorisation.
    assessment_notes: |
      For sensitive data use, apply sanitisation, access controls and output logging.

  fair_with_harmful_bias_managed:
    bias_mitigation: |
      Model supports 32-language OCR and broad pre-training; no detailed bias audit published.
    known_biases: |
      May under-perform on extremely niche languages, rare scripts, or specific video domains not well covered.
    assessment_notes: |
      Conduct bias/fairness assessment for under-represented languages and modalities in your domain.

evaluation_guidance:
  recommended_tests: |
    - Evaluate model on your multimodal tasks: image + text, video + text, long-document, long-video inputs.
    - Measure accuracy of visual perception (object detection, spatial reasoning), OCR (32 languages), and tool invocation performance.
    - Benchmark long‐context behaviour: test with large documents (256K+ tokens) or long video chains.
    - Test latency and resource usage on your hardware for target use-case.
    - Safety/red-teaming: test for hallucination, mis-tool-invocations, bad behavioural outputs especially in edge cases.
    - Check prompt design: ensure system/purpose alignment, multi-modal input formatting correct.

  key_evaluation_questions: |
    - Does the model meet your accuracy/fidelity requirements for image/video understanding and reasoning tasks?
    - Is your hardware and infrastructure capable of supporting required memory, compute and context length?
    - Do you have human-in-the-loop review for outputs especially if used in decision workflows?
    - Are your licensing, deployment and governance controls aligned with open-source Apache 2.0 and your internal policy?

  comparison_considerations: |
    - Compare with other vision‐language models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL, other open multimodal models) in terms of parameter size vs lost performance vs context length vs modalities.
    - Assess whether you need full 1 M token context/video support or a lighter model would suffice.
    - Evaluate cost/benefit: 8B parameters with multimodal support vs larger or smaller models depending on throughput/latency.

  govern:
    notes: |
      Versioning, prompt usage logging, multi-modal input review, downstream tool-invocation audit.

    risk_management_considerations: |
      Implement human review, versioning of model/prompt/config, monitoring of multi‐modal usage, fallback strategies for high‐risk prompts, prompt sanitation and policy enforcement.
