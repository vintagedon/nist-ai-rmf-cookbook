# MODEL ARCHITECTURE & TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
# =============================================================================

technical_specifications:
  architecture:
    base_architecture: "Transformer decoder with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture (based on industry reports)"
    
    parameter_count: "Not publicly disclosed by OpenAI. Industry estimates: ~1.76-1.8 trillion parameters total across 16 expert models (~110B parameters each, or 8 models with ~220B each). During inference, only ~280B parameters utilized per query via MoE routing."
    
    context_window: "8,192 tokens (standard) and 32,768 tokens (extended version). Later versions support up to 128,000 tokens."
    
    training_data_cutoff: "September 2021 (initial version, per official documentation). Later versions updated to April 2023, then December 2023."

    architectural_details: |
      GPT-4 uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) transformer decoder architecture (per industry analysis, 
      not officially confirmed by OpenAI). The MoE design consists of multiple expert neural networks 
      that specialize in specific tasks or data types, with a gating network that routes each query 
      to the most appropriate 2 experts per forward pass. This architecture allows the model to scale 
      to ~1.8 trillion total parameters while only activating ~280 billion per inference, keeping 
      computational costs practical.
      
      Multimodal capabilities: Can process both text and image inputs (though outputs limited to text). 
      Uses image encoder to process visual inputs.
      
      Training: Two-stage process - (1) Pre-training via next-token prediction on large internet text 
      dataset, (2) Fine-tuning with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align with 
      human preferences and follow instructions.
      
      System messages: Introduced capability for developers to specify model behavior via system messages 
      (natural language directives that set tone, task, and style).
      
      Training cost: Exceeded $100 million. Utilized approximately 25,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs over 90-100 
      days, processing ~13 trillion tokens.

  modalities:
    supported_inputs: ["text", "image"]
    
    supported_outputs: ["text"]

  performance_characteristics:
    speed_tier: "Resource intensive - Requires GPU clusters for deployment (128 A100 GPUs for inference per industry reports)"
    
    cost_tier: "High - API pricing: $0.03 per 1K prompt tokens, $0.06 per 1K completion tokens (8K context), doubled for 32K context"
    
    latency: "Near real-time for API responses - specific latency not publicly disclosed"
    
    throughput: "Designed for high throughput via batched inference on GPU clusters - specific tokens/second not publicly disclosed"

  known_limitations:
    vendor_disclosed: |
      From OpenAI GPT-4 System Card (extensive disclosure):
      
      1. Hallucinations: "GPT-4 has the tendency to 'hallucinate,' i.e. 'produce content that is 
         nonsensical or untruthful in relation to certain sources.'" Can become more dangerous as 
         model becomes more convincing and users build trust.
      
      2. Harmful Content Generation: Without mitigations, can generate:
         - Hate speech and discriminatory language
         - Advice for self-harm behaviors
         - Graphic erotic or violent content
         - Instructions for harmful or illegal activities
         - Content for planning attacks
      
      3. Bias and Stereotypes: "Continues to reinforce social biases and worldviews" and can 
         "reinforce and reproduce specific biases and worldviews, including harmful stereotypical 
         and demeaning associations for certain marginalized groups."
      
      4. Privacy Risks: "May have knowledge about people who have a significant presence on the 
         public internet." Can potentially identify private individuals when augmented with outside data.
      
      5. Cybersecurity Limitations: "Useful for some subtasks of social engineering" and "explaining 
         some vulnerabilities" but "significant limitations due to hallucination tendency and limited 
         context window."
      
      6. Jailbreaks: "GPT-4 can still be vulnerable to adversarial attacks and exploits or 
         'jailbreaks.'" Model-level refusals remain "brittle in some cases."
      
      7. Overreliance Risk: "Despite GPT-4's capabilities, it maintains a tendency to make up facts, 
         to double-down on incorrect information, and to perform tasks incorrectly... often in ways 
         that are more convincing and believable than earlier GPT models."
      
      8. Limited Context Window: Original 8K/32K token limits (though later extended)
      
      9. Does Not Learn: Cannot update knowledge from conversations or learn new information
      
      10. Safety Mitigations Not Perfect: "While our mitigations and processes alter GPT-4's 
          behavior and prevent certain kinds of misuses, they are limited and remain brittle."

    common_failure_modes: |
      From extensive red team testing and adversarial evaluation documented in System Card:
      
      - Hallucinating facts with authoritative tone, making errors harder to detect
      - Generating plausible but false information, especially on specialized topics
      - System message attacks can bypass safety controls
      - Prompt injection and jailbreaking techniques can elicit harmful content
      - Performance degradation on complex multi-step reasoning
      - Inconsistent refusal behavior (may refuse benign requests while complying with harmful ones)
      - Hedging behavior that can inadvertently foster overreliance
      - Potential for generating discriminatory content even for non-harmful requests
      - Variations in language performance (stronger in English, weaker in some low-resource languages)
      - Sycophancy (tendency to repeat back user's preferred answer)
      - Can be steered to produce misleading or propagandistic content
      - Token dropping in MoE architecture leads to non-deterministic outputs

    unsuitable_use_cases: |
      Explicitly prohibited or unsuitable per OpenAI System Card and Usage Policies:
      
      - High-stakes government decision making (law enforcement, criminal justice, migration/asylum)

      - Financial trading or credit scoring as sole decision-maker
      - Any context where errors could cause significant individual or societal harm
      - Content moderation (lacks built-in moderation capabilities)
      - Applications requiring perfect accuracy or factual reliability
      - Autonomous systems without human oversight
      - Use cases requiring real-time information (beyond training cutoff without search augmentation)
      - Applications where bias could lead to discriminatory outcomes without mitigation
      - Generating content intended to deceive or manipulate
      - Disinformation campaigns or influence operations
      - Creating malware, exploits, or conducting cyberattacks

      - System message attacks can bypass safeguards
      - Refusal behavior sometimes inconsistent
      - May refuse benign requests while complying with harmful ones
      - Safety mitigations may exacerbate bias in some contexts
      - No built-in content moderation - requires external controls
      - "Fundamental capabilities of the pre-trained model, such as the potential to 
        generate harmful content, remain latent"
      - Critical to implement multiple defense layers (model + system + policies)
      - Regular adversarial testing and updates essential
      - Usage monitoring and enforcement required

  secure_and_resilient:
    vendor_claims: |
      OpenAI tested cybersecurity capabilities:
      - Red team evaluation found model "useful for some subtasks of social engineering"
      - Can explain vulnerabilities in code
      - "Does not improve upon existing tools" for reconnaissance or exploitation
      - Less effective than existing tools for "complex and high-level activities"
    
    public_evidence: |
      System Card documents security testing:
      - Expert red teamers tested vulnerability discovery and exploitation
      - Social engineering capabilities evaluated
      - Examples provided of vulnerability detection in code
      - Acknowledged potential for misuse in phishing, drafting malicious content
      - ARC testing showed limited autonomous capability for resource acquisition

      - Hallucination tendency limits effectiveness for complex attacks
      - Vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking
      - Could accelerate certain attack phases (social engineering, code analysis)
      - Not a "ready-made upgrade" to current cyberattack capabilities
      - Recommend adversarial testing for security vulnerabilities
      - Monitor for misuse in cybersecurity contexts
      - Implement content filtering for security-sensitive queries
      - System-level security (API keys, access controls) critical
      - No disclosed resilience testing for availability attacks

  accountable_and_transparent:
    vendor_claims: |
      OpenAI provides System Card with extensive documentation but limited technical transparency:
      - Comprehensive 69-page system card documenting risks and mitigations
      - Benchmark results and safety metrics published
      - Red teaming process and findings shared
      - Usage policies and terms clearly stated
    
    public_evidence: |
      Significant transparency gaps:
      - Deliberately withheld technical architecture details
      - Did not disclose parameter count, model size, or hardware
      - Training dataset composition and sources not revealed
      - Hyperparameters, learning rates not specified
      - Cited "competitive landscape and safety implications" for secrecy
      - This decision received criticism from research community
      - Cost estimate ($100M+) disclosed but not detailed breakdown
    
    assessment_notes: |
      Mixed transparency picture:
      - Excellent risk communication and safety documentation
      - Comprehensive evaluation methodology disclosed
      - Strong documentation of limitations and failure modes
      - However, minimal technical transparency creates challenges:
        * Cannot independently verify capabilities
        * Difficult to audit for bias or security issues
        * Limited reproducibility for research
        * Deployment decisions lack full information
      - Recommend:
        * Comprehensive logging of model usage and decisions
        * Document all deployment contexts and mitigations
        * Implement audit trails for high-stakes applications
        * Transparency with end users about AI involvement
        * Regular external audits where possible

  explainable_and_interpretable:
    vendor_claims: |
      OpenAI provides limited interpretability features:
      - System messages allow some behavioral control
      - Can be prompted to explain reasoning (chain-of-thought)
      - No specialized interpretability mechanisms disclosed
    
    public_evidence: |
      Standard LLM interpretability challenges:
      - Large parameter count (~1.8T) makes interpretation difficult
      - MoE architecture adds complexity with token routing
      - Emergent capabilities hard to predict or explain
      - System Card notes some capabilities were predictable, others not
    
    assessment_notes: |
      Significant interpretability limitations:
      - Black box model with minimal built-in explanation
      - Cannot reliably explain why specific outputs generated
      - Emergent behaviors may appear unexpectedly
      - Reasoning may be post-hoc rationalization, not true explanation
      - Non-deterministic outputs due to token dropping complicate debugging
      - Recommend:
        * Implement application-level logging and explanation
        * Use chain-of-thought prompting for transparency
        * External interpretability tools may be necessary
        * Document decision logic for high-stakes applications
        * Consider simpler models where interpretability critical

  privacy_enhanced:
    vendor_claims: |
      OpenAI implemented privacy mitigations:
      - Removed personal information from training dataset "where feasible"
      - Fine-tuned to reject personal information requests
      - Automated evaluations for privacy violations
      - Monitoring for attempts to extract personal information
      - Usage policies prohibit privacy violations
    
    public_evidence: |
      System Card acknowledges privacy risks:
      - "May have knowledge about people who have a significant presence on the public internet"
      - Can "synthesize multiple, distinct information types"
      - "Potential to be used to attempt to identify individuals when augmented with outside data"
      - No disclosed PII filtering methodology
      - No privacy-preserving training techniques mentioned
    
    assessment_notes: |
      Significant privacy concerns remain:
      - Training on public internet data includes personal information
      - No comprehensive PII filtering in training
      - Model may memorize and reproduce personal details
      - Can be augmented with external data for identification
      - No differential privacy or federated learning employed
      - Recommend:
        * Implement PII detection/redaction in application layer
        * Monitor for personal information in outputs
        * Data minimization in prompts
        * Clear privacy policies for end users
        * Comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
        * Consider data retention and deletion policies
        * Extensive context windows may increase memorization risk

    vendor_claims: |
      OpenAI acknowledges bias issues:
      - System Card extensively documents bias and representation harms
      - "Both GPT-4-early and GPT-4-launch continue to reinforce social biases"
      - Training mitigations for some types of bias via refusals
      - 50+ diverse red teamers provided bias evaluation
    
    public_evidence: |
      System Card documents bias extensively:
      - Examples of stereotypical content generation provided
      - Performance varies across languages (stronger English, weaker some Asian languages)
      - Can generate discriminatory content and stereotypes
      - Hedging behavior may exacerbate bias in some contexts
      - Red team testing revealed bias in various domains
      - Refusals can themselves exhibit bias
    
    bias_mitigation: |
      Documented mitigation approaches:
      - Training to refuse explicitly stereotyping/demeaning content
      - RLHF training with diverse human feedback
      - Red team testing with diverse expert groups
      - Content filtering and classification
      - However: "Refusals and other mitigations can also exacerbate bias in some contexts"
    
    known_biases: |
      Documented biases and fairness issues:
      - Social biases and worldview reinforcement
      - Stereotypical associations for marginalized groups
      - Inappropriate hedging on sensitive topics (e.g., women's voting rights)
      - Language performance gaps (English strongest, variation in other languages)
      - Potential disparate impact in different contexts
      - Sycophancy (agreeing with user regardless of correctness)
      - Default assumptions about relationships, identities (e.g., heteronormative)
      - Cultural biases reflecting training data distribution
      - Potential for discrimination in quality of service
    
    assessment_notes: |
      Critical fairness challenges:
      - Bias mitigation partial and context-dependent
      - Refusals can create disparate performance across groups
      - Performance variation across languages may disadvantage speakers
      - "As use data influences the world it is trained on, AI systems will have 
        even greater potential to reinforce entire ideologies, worldviews, truths 
        and untruths, and to cement them"
      - Recommend:
        * Extensive bias testing for specific deployment contexts
        * Evaluate performance across demographic groups relevant to use case
        * Test language performance for target user populations
        * Monitor for disparate impact in production
        * Implement fairness metrics and thresholds
        * Regular bias audits and external evaluation
        * Diverse human oversight and review
        * Consider whether unequal performance creates fairness issues
        * Document known biases and mitigation strategies
