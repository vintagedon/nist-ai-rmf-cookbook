# # Guidance on suitable, unsuitable, and out-of-scope applications.
# # =============================================================================
intended_use:
  vendor_intended_use: |
    Creative workflows requiring image generation and conversational, multi-turn editing capabilities. Applications include generating consistent characters, prompt-based editing, and combining image understanding with generation. [16, 17]
  suitable_domains:
  - "creative_tools"
  - "marketing_and_advertising"
  - "design_prototyping"

# # [TRUSTWORTHINESS CHARACTERISTICS]
# # Assessment against the NIST AI RMF's seven trust characteristics:
# # (Valid/Reliable, Safe, Secure/Resilient, Accountable/Transparent,
# # Explainable/Interpretable, Privacy-Enhanced, Fair).
# # =============================================================================
trustworthiness_assessment:
  valid_and_reliable:
    vendor_claims: |
      Provides reliable control for a huge range of applications, including maintaining subject identity and intelligent, prompt-based editing. [16]
    public_evidence: |
      Public examples and tutorials demonstrate its capabilities in conversational editing and visual reasoning. [18]
    assessment_notes: |
      Appears highly capable for creative and interactive workflows. Reliability for specific, complex compositions should be tested.
  safe:
    safety_measures: |
      Includes built-in safety filters and SynthID watermarking for transparency. [16]
    known_safety_issues: |
      Potential for misuse in creating deceptive media, though mitigated by watermarking.
    assessment_notes: |
      The inclusion of SynthID is a significant safety and transparency feature.
  secure_and_resilient:
    security_features: |
      Accessed via Google's secure API infrastructure.
    known_vulnerabilities: |
      Potential for adversarial prompts designed to bypass safety filters.
    assessment_notes: |
      Standard security posture for a cloud-hosted generative model.
  accountable_and_transparent:
    transparency_level: "Medium"
    auditability: |
      SynthID watermarking provides a mechanism for auditing the provenance of generated images. The model card is publicly available.
    assessment_notes: |
      Watermarking enhances accountability. Transparency into the model's internal workings remains limited.
  explainable_and_interpretable:
    explainability_features: |
      The model's ability to engage in conversational refinement provides a degree of interactive explainability.
    interpretability_limitations: |
      The underlying generation process is a black box.
    assessment_notes: |
      Focus is on user control and interaction rather than mechanistic interpretability.
  privacy_enhanced:
    privacy_features: |
      Operates within Google's cloud privacy and data handling policies.
    privacy_concerns: |
      Training data sources are not fully disclosed.
    assessment_notes: |
      Suitable for enterprise use under Google Cloud's data processing agreements.
  fair_with_harmful_bias_managed:
    bias_mitigation: |
      Subject to Google's internal bias mitigation efforts during data curation and model training.
    known_biases: |
      May reproduce societal biases related to demographics and culture present in the training data.
    assessment_notes: |
      Requires careful prompt engineering and output review to manage potential biases in production applications.
# # =============================================================================
# # [EVALUATION GUIDANCE]
# # Recommendations for testing, validating, and comparing the model.
# # =============================================================================
evaluation_guidance:
  recommended_tests: |
    - Test for subject consistency across a series of generated images with varying scenes and poses.
    - Evaluate the precision of conversational editing for adding, removing, and modifying elements.
    - Assess the quality of text rendering for logos and diagrams.
    - Red-team with prompts designed to test safety filter boundaries.
  key_evaluation_questions: |
    - How robust is subject identity retention for our specific art style and characters?
    - Does the conversational editing workflow improve efficiency compared to traditional text-to-image regeneration?
  comparison_considerations: |
    Compare against other leading text-to-image models (e.g., Imagen 4, Midjourney, DALL-E) on image quality, prompt adherence, and unique features like conversational editing.
