# # =============================================================================
# # [EVALUATION GUIDANCE]
# # Recommendations for testing, validating, and comparing the model.
# # =============================================================================
evaluation_guidance:
  recommended_tests: |
    - Latency and throughput benchmarking to validate its performance for high-volume applications.
    - A/B testing against Imagen 4 to assess the quality trade-off for the target use case.
    - Cost analysis for large-scale generation tasks to confirm TCO benefits.
  key_evaluation_questions: |
    - Is the generation speed fast enough for our interactive application's user experience?
    - Is the image quality sufficient for our social media and content marketing needs?
  comparison_considerations: |
    Compare against other speed-focused image generation models on the market. The primary internal comparison is the cost/speed/quality trade-off against the standard and Ultra versions of Imagen 4.
