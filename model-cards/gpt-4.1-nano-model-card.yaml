    - Technical details (parameters, architecture, distillation methods) not disclosed
    - Training data details not publicly disclosed
    - Nano-specific safety benchmark scores not published separately
    - Information gathered October 28, 2025; model released April 14, 2025

  completeness_assessment: |
    Assessment of information completeness by section:
    
    Comprehensive Information:
    - Model identity and basic specifications (release date, context window, pricing)
    - Key benchmark scores: MMLU (80.1%), GPQA (50.3%), Aider (9.8%)
    - Pricing structure ($0.10/$0.40 per million tokens, 75% cache discount)
    - Intended use cases clearly documented (autocomplete, classification, extraction)
    - API specifications and integration details
    - Licensing and usage policies
    
    Partial Information:
    - Performance characteristics (some details from OpenAI, others inferred)
    - Comparison with other models (well-covered by third parties)
    - Limitations acknowledged but not comprehensively detailed
    - Safety measures (high-level approach, but nano-specific details limited)
    - Use case examples from third parties
    
    Critical Gaps:
    - Parameter count not disclosed (only described as "smallest")
    - Training data composition, sources, and sizes not disclosed
    - Detailed architecture not disclosed
    - Distillation or optimization techniques not detailed (how nano created from larger models)
    - Specific safety training approaches not detailed
    - Nano-specific safety benchmark scores not published separately
    - Limited discussion in announcement materials vs. larger models
    - No comprehensive "model card" or safety report from OpenAI
    - Bias testing methodology and results not disclosed
    - Long-term performance data limited (recent release)
    
    What Would Improve Confidence:
    - Official OpenAI model card with standardized nano-specific disclosures
    - Safety report with nano-specific testing methodology and results
    - More detailed technical documentation on optimization for speed/cost
    - Information on distillation or compression techniques used
    - Independent third-party safety and bias audits focused on nano
    - Longer track record of production use and issue reports
    - Published case studies from nano deployments
    - Comparative benchmarking by independent organizations
    - Disclosure of architectural differences from larger models
    
    Nano-Specific Gaps:
    - How capabilities reduced from larger models (distillation? pruning? separate training?)
    - What specific trade-offs made for speed optimization
    - Detailed performance comparison with mini and full GPT-4.1
    - Guidance on when nano sufficient vs. when to upgrade
    - Nano-specific failure modes and edge cases
    
    Overall Assessment:
    Information is sufficient for initial evaluation of nano for simple use cases
    (classification, extraction, autocomplete). However, significant transparency gaps
    exist, especially around how nano was created and optimized. Organizations should:
    - Test extensively on their specific use cases before production
    - Start with simple tasks and validate nano is sufficient
    - Establish clear escalation paths to larger models
    - Monitor production performance closely
    - Accept that nano is optimized for speed/cost, not maximum capability
    
    The card provides actionable guidance based on available information, but deployers
    must validate through testing that nano meets their specific requirements. The very
    limited capability relative to larger models means thorough evaluation is critical.
