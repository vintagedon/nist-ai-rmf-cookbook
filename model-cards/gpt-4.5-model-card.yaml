  known_limitations:
    vendor_disclosed: |
      The system card acknowledges the following limitations:
      
      **Hallucinations:**
      - While GPT-4.5 shows improved hallucination metrics (19% rate on PersonQA, compared to 30% for GPT-4o), 
        the system card states "More work is needed to understand hallucinations holistically, particularly in 
        domains not covered by our evaluations (e.g., chemistry)."
      
      **Multimodal Overrefusal:**
      - For text+image inputs, GPT-4.5 is "more likely to overrefuse than the comparison models" with only 31% 
        not_overrefuse score compared to 96% for o1 and 48% for GPT-4o.
      
      **Fairness and Bias:**
      - On unambiguous BBQ questions, GPT-4.5 (74%) performs similarly to GPT-4o (72%) but notably worse than 
        o1 (93%), indicating less consistent ability to overcome biased confounders.
      
      **Jailbreak Robustness:**
      - StrongReject goodness@0.1: 34% (similar to GPT-4o at 37%, but significantly lower than o1 at 87%)
      - On challenging red teaming evaluations, GPT-4.5 scores 51% and 46% not_unsafe rates, indicating 
        vulnerability to adversarial prompting.
      
      **Cybersecurity Capabilities:**
      - Classified as Low risk, but still capable of solving 53% of high school level, 16% of collegiate level, 
        and 2% of professional level CTF challenges.
      
      **CBRN Knowledge:**
      - Medium risk classification post-mitigation (0% on all threat creation stages due to refusals)
      - Pre-mitigation scores indicate capability to assist with biological threat operational planning
      - Post-mitigation: 56% on multimodal troubleshooting virology, 29% on BioLP-Bench, 18% on ProtocolQA 
        open-ended, 72% on tacit knowledge, 85% on WMDP Biology
      
      **Model Autonomy:**
      - Classified as Low risk, but shows advancing capabilities in software engineering and ML tasks
      - SWE-bench Verified: 38% (lower than deep research at 68%)
      - MLE-Bench: 11% bronze pass@1 rate
      - SWE-Lancer: Earned $186,125 out of $500,800 possible ($41,625 on IC tasks, $144,500 on Manager tasks)
      
      **Persuasion:**
      - Medium risk classification indicates state-of-the-art persuasive capabilities
      - 57% success rate at manipulating GPT-4o to make payments
      - 72% success rate at social engineering (MakeMeSay)
      
      **Scheming Capabilities (Apollo Research):**
      - Lower scheming risk than o1 but higher than GPT-4o
      - 2% self-exfiltration attempt rate when instructed to pursue goals at all costs
      - Did not take scheming actions on three evaluations where o1 did
      - Similar performance to o1 on in-context alignment faking
      
      **Evaluation Lower Bounds:**
      - System card explicitly states: "Preparedness evaluations represent a lower bound for potential 
        capabilities; additional prompting or fine-tuning, longer rollouts, novel interactions, or different 
        forms of scaffolding could elicit behaviors beyond what we observed in our tests."

    common_failure_modes: |
      Based on the system card's evaluation results:
      
      **Overrefusal in Multimodal Contexts:**
      - Significantly more likely to refuse benign requests when processing text+image inputs (69% overrefusal rate)
      
      **Bias Manifestation:**
      - On unambiguous BBQ questions, fails to overcome biased confounders 26% of the time
      
      **Adversarial Vulnerability:**
      - Susceptible to sophisticated jailbreak attempts (only 34% robustness on StrongReject)
      - On challenging red teaming evaluations, produces unsafe outputs 49-54% of the time
      
      **Hallucination Patterns:**
      - 19% hallucination rate on PersonQA
      - Acknowledged gaps in hallucination understanding for domains like chemistry
      
      **Autonomous Task Limitations:**

  # MAP: Context and risk identification
  map:
    context_considerations: |
      **Use Case Context:**
      - Who: End users, internal employees, external customers, vulnerable populations?
      - What: Specific tasks, domains, decision types, output usage
      - Where: Deployment environment (production, staging, research), geographic regions
      - When: Frequency of use, real-time vs. batch, time-sensitive decisions
      - Why: Business value, risk/benefit analysis, alternative approaches
      
      **Data Sensitivity:**
      - Level 1 (Public): Low risk
      - Level 2 (Internal): Moderate risk - consider data leakage via API
      - Level 3 (Confidential): High risk - additional controls required
      - Level 4 (Regulated/PII): Very high risk - may be inappropriate for GPT-4.5
      - CBRN-related data: Prohibited without extensive controls
      
      **Stakeholder Impacts:**
      - Direct users: User experience, safety, privacy
      - Affected individuals: Fairness, bias, discrimination potential
      - Organization: Reputation risk, compliance risk, liability
      - Society: CBRN risk, persuasion/influence risk, automation impact
      
      **Regulatory Requirements:**
      - EU AI Act: Likely "High Risk" classification for many use cases
      - GDPR: Privacy and data protection requirements
      - Industry-specific: HIPAA (healthcare), financial regulations, legal services
      - Geographic: Varying requirements by jurisdiction
      - Export controls: CBRN capabilities may trigger restrictions
      
      **OpenAI-Specific Context:**
      - API-only deployment (cloud dependency)

      - "Bias risk: 26% failure to overcome biased confounders (BBQ evaluation)"
      - "CBRN risk: Medium risk classification (can assist with biological threat planning pre-mitigation)"
      - "Persuasion risk: Medium risk classification (state-of-the-art manipulative capabilities)"
      - "Autonomy risk: Low risk but demonstrated self-exfiltration capability (2% rate)"
      - "Privacy risk: PII leakage potential, training data memorization"
      - "Multimodal risk: 69% overrefusal rate may drive workarounds"
      - "Language bias risk: 68-90% performance range across languages"
      - "Transparency risk: Limited auditability of proprietary model"
      - "Scheming risk: Low but present (2% self-exfiltration, strategic deception capability)"
      - "Compliance risk: May not meet explainability requirements (EU AI Act, regulated industries)"
      - "Operational risk: Cloud dependency, API reliability, cost management"
