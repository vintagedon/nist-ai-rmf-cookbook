    with gains in reasoning and math and improved performance on long-running tasks. 
  benchmark_performance: |
    Vendor highlights improvements vs. Claude Sonnet 4 and Opus 4 on coding/agentic tasks; specific third-party benchmark
    numbers are not comprehensively published in the announcement.

  known_limitations:
    vendor_disclosed: |
      Anthropic system cards emphasize residual risks (e.g., jailbreaks, dual-use assistance) and document mitigations,
      but do not claim elimination of hallucinations or bias.
    common_failure_modes: |
      Standard LLM failure modes may persist: hallucinations, susceptibility to adversarial prompting, long-context drift.
    unsuitable_use_cases: |
      Safety-critical or regulated decision making without human oversight; biosafety/cyber-dual-use assistance beyond
      documented safeguards.

# # =============================================================================
# # [INTENDED USE & SCOPE]
# # Guidance on suitable, unsuitable, and out-of-scope applications.
# # =============================================================================
intended_use:
  vendor_intended_use: |
    General assistant with emphasis on coding, multi-tool "agentic" workflows, and autonomous computer use for complex tasks.
  suitable_domains: ["general_purpose", "code_generation", "agentic_tool_use", "analysis", "multimodal_reasoning"]
  out_of_scope_use: |
    High-stakes domains (medical/legal/financial decisions) without domain controls and human review; sensitive dual-use domains
    without appropriate safeguards.

# # =============================================================================
# # [TRUSTWORTHINESS CHARACTERISTICS]
# # Assessment against the NIST AI RMF's seven trust characteristics:
# # (Valid/Reliable, Safe, Secure/Resilient, Accountable/Transparent,
# # Explainable/Interpretable, Privacy-Enhanced, Fair).
# # =============================================================================
trustworthiness_assessment:
  valid_and_reliable:
    vendor_claims: |
      Substantial quality gains over prior Claude 4 models for coding/agents/computer use.
    public_evidence: |
      Described in the Sonnet 4.5 announcement and system card; broader third-party replication is still emerging.
    assessment_notes: |
      Strong vendor positioning with growing public coverage; treat claims as requiring domain-specific validation.
  safe:
    safety_measures: |
      System card details evaluations, red-teaming, and mitigations aligned to Anthropic’s Responsible Scaling/ASL approach.
    known_safety_issues: |
      Residual jailbreak and dual-use concerns common to LLMs; mitigations reduce but do not eliminate risk.
    assessment_notes: |
      Safety posture appears strengthened relative to prior Sonnet; application-level controls still required.
  secure_and_resilient:
    security_features: |
      Guardrails and classifiers; documented prompt-injection awareness in system cards; platform-level controls.
    known_vulnerabilities: |
      General LLM threats (prompt injection, data exfiltration via tool use/computer use).
    assessment_notes: |
      Integrators must implement least-privilege tool scopes, network egress controls, and monitoring.
  accountable_and_transparent:
    transparency_level: "Medium"
    auditability: |
      System card and announcements available; detailed internals (params/data) are not disclosed.
    assessment_notes: |
      Documentation of safety process is good; technical opacity remains on architecture/scale/data.
  explainable_and_interpretable:
    explainability_features: |
      Operational traces via tool/computer use improve observability; no native mechanistic interpretability guarantees.
    interpretability_limitations: |
      Opaque internal reasoning; step-by-step internal traces not exposed by default.
    assessment_notes: |
      Adequate for ops oversight; fundamental interpretability limits persist.
  privacy_enhanced:
    privacy_features: |
      Policy/process safeguards; enterprise deployment options via partner clouds.
    privacy_concerns: |
      Lack of granular training data provenance/retention disclosures.
    assessment_notes: |
      Fit for many enterprise contexts with contractual and technical controls.
  fair_with_harmful_bias_managed:
    bias_mitigation: |
      Safety evaluation pipeline and filters; red-teaming across sensitive categories.
    known_biases: |
      Standard demographic/linguistic biases may persist.
    assessment_notes: |
      Perform domain-specific bias testing before high-impact use.

# # =============================================================================
# # [EVALUATION GUIDANCE]
# # Recommendations for testing, validating, and comparing the model.
# # =============================================================================
evaluation_guidance:
  recommended_tests: |
    - Coding task suites relevant to your stack (unit tests, repair tasks)
    - Agentic workflows: tool/computer-use success rate, rollback/retry behavior
    - Jailbreak/prompt-injection resilience for your domain
    - Long-running task stability, cost and latency profiling
  key_evaluation_questions: |
    - Does computer-use capability deliver measurable productivity safely?
    - Are coding gains material vs. alternatives (Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5)?
    - What monitoring/guardrails are needed for our tools/data?
  comparison_considerations: |
    - Coding/agentic strength vs GPT-5 "thinking"/tools; cost/latency vs open-weights + RAG; safety posture and enterprise fit.

# # Measure, Manage).
# # =============================================================================
rmf_function_mapping:
  govern:
    notes: |
      Require human oversight for agentic actions; define approval flows for computer-use; restrict tool scopes by role.

      Identify dual-use exposure, data sensitivity, and autonomy boundaries for computer-use tasks.
    risk_categories: ["hallucination", "prompt_injection", "tool_misuse", "privacy_leakage", "bias", "cost_overrun"]
  measure:
    suggested_metrics: |
      Coding task pass rate; agentic success + rollback rate; jailbreak pass rate; latency and $/task under realistic workloads.
  manage:
    risk_management_considerations: |
      Network and filesystem sandboxing for computer-use; egress controls; periodic red-team; audit trails for tool actions.
