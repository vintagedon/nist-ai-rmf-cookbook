    architectural_details: |
      Yi 1.5 34B is the flagship bilingual model from 01.AI’s Yi 1.5 family,
      designed for enterprise-scale reasoning, summarization, and translation.
      It extends the Yi 34B architecture with improved cross-lingual balance, factual grounding,
      and alignment fine-tuning using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
      Incorporates rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), grouped-query attention (GQA),
      and high-efficiency tensor parallelism for 16K context reasoning.
  modalities:
    supported_inputs: ["text"]
    supported_outputs: ["text"]
  performance_characteristics:
    speed_tier: "Moderate (large model)"
    cost_tier: "Free / Open-weight"
    latency: |
      ~0.32 s per 1K tokens (fp16 A100); ~0.10 s INT4 quantized (RTX 4090).  
      Optimized for high-accuracy RAG and bilingual research deployments.
    throughput: |
      High scaling efficiency across multi-GPU inference and tensor parallel clusters.
