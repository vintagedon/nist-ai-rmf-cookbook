    Gemini Pro is Google's frontier multimodal AI model used as a multi-model consensus partner
    in the NIST AI RMF Cookbook repository. It provides diverse reasoning perspectives, particularly
    strong in structured analysis and long-context understanding, serving as a third opinion in
    critical documentation tasks alongside Claude and GPT-4.

    In the NIST AI RMF Cookbook repository, Gemini Pro is used for:
    - Multi-model consensus analysis (third opinion alongside Claude and GPT-4)
    - Long-context analysis when dealing with extensive documentation
    - Structured reasoning and framework mapping
    - Alternative perspective generation for policy design
    - Cross-validation of technical accuracy
  
  primary_users: "Repository maintainer (VintageDon) and potentially approved contributors"
  
  out_of_scope_uses: |
    - NOT used as the sole authority on compliance decisions
    - NOT used for final content without human verification
    - NOT used with credentials, secrets, or sensitive personal information
    - NOT used for content where training data usage restrictions prohibit API submission

ethical_considerations:
  known_biases: |
    As a commercial LLM, Gemini Pro has potential biases including:
    - Google's corporate perspective on AI safety and governance
    - Training data biases common to large language models
    - Possible overemphasis on certain approaches to AI risk management
    These biases are mitigated through multi-model consensus and human review.
  
  mitigation_strategy: |
    Repository methodology mitigates Gemini-specific biases through:
    1. Multi-model consensus (2-3 models including Claude and GPT-4)
    2. Models cross-review each other's outputs
    3. Human verification against authoritative sources (NIST publications, ISO standards)
    4. Diverse model providers prevents single-vendor perspective lock-in
    5. Explicit documentation of AI involvement in all outputs

  fairness_considerations: |
    In the repository context (documentation generation), fairness concerns are addressed by:
    - Ensuring documentation is accessible to diverse audiences
    - Using clear, jargon-free language where possible
    - Providing multiple perspectives through multi-model consensus
    - Human review for inclusivity and accessibility

  transparency_approach: |
    Full transparency maintained through:
    - Disclosure in front matter (ai_contributor field)
    - Documentation methodology explaining Gemini's role
    - Git history showing all AI-assisted contributions
    - This model card documenting capabilities and limitations

model_usage_guidelines:
  recommended_practices:
    - "Use as third opinion in multi-model consensus (alongside Claude and GPT-4)"
    - "Leverage long-context capabilities for analyzing entire documentation sets"
    - "Request structured analysis and systematic reasoning"
    - "Provide clear context about NIST AI RMF and repository goals"
    - "Use iterative refinement based on model outputs"
  
  prompt_engineering_notes: |
    Gemini Pro responds well to:
    - Structured prompts with clear objectives
    - Requests for systematic analysis
    - Long-context tasks (full documents, multiple frameworks)
    - Step-by-step reasoning prompts
    - Specific format requests (tables, lists, structured outputs)
  
  when_to_use_gemini:
    - "Need third perspective in multi-model consensus"
    - "Analyzing very long documents or multiple frameworks simultaneously"
    - "Structured reasoning and systematic analysis tasks"
    - "Cross-referencing across large documentation sets"
    - "Want vendor diversity (not just Anthropic/OpenAI)"
  
  when_not_to_use:
    - "Quick syntax checks (use local models)"
    - "Tasks where Google's usage policies are restrictive"
    - "Content that requires specific anthropomorphic tone"

  deployment_environment: "Google AI Studio API (https://ai.google.dev) and Vertex AI"
  serving_infrastructure: "Managed by Google - Google Cloud Platform infrastructure"
  deployment_date: "2024-10 (repository project start)"
  
  access_configuration:
    api_access: "Via Google AI Studio API keys (not stored in repository)"
    data_usage: "Configured to prevent submitted content from being used for model improvement"
    data_retention: "Per Google Cloud / AI Studio data usage policies"
  
  monitoring_approach: |
    No formal technical monitoring (API access only). Quality monitoring through:
    - Human assessment of output quality per task
    - Comparison against Claude and GPT-4 outputs in consensus process
    - Git history tracking all contributions
    - Community review through GitHub pull requests
  
  cost_considerations: |
    Gemini Pro API usage has per-token costs. Repository usage is:
    - Intermittent (not continuous)
    - Strategic use as third opinion in multi-model consensus
    - Cost-effective due to free tier availability for light usage
    - Long context window provides unique value for certain tasks
  
  rollback_plan: |
    If Gemini Pro availability or quality issues arise:
    - Continue with Claude + GPT-4 two-model consensus
    - Document limitations and adjust methodology
    - Consider alternative models if persistent issues
    - Maintain vendor diversity through other providers
