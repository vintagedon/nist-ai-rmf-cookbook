ethical_considerations:
  known_biases: |
    As a commercial LLM, Claude has potential biases including:
    - Anthropic's perspective on AI safety and Constitutional AI principles
    - Training data biases common to large language models
    - Possible Western/English-language bias in some contexts
    These biases are mitigated through multi-model consensus and human review.
  
  mitigation_strategy: |
    Repository methodology mitigates Claude-specific biases through:
    1. Multi-model consensus (2-3 models including GPT-4 and Gemini)
    2. Models cross-review each other's outputs
    3. Human verification against authoritative sources (NIST publications, ISO standards)
    4. Conservative approach to uncertain claims
    5. Explicit documentation of AI involvement in all outputs

  fairness_considerations: |
    In the repository context (documentation generation), fairness concerns are addressed by:
    - Ensuring documentation is accessible to diverse audiences
    - Using clear, jargon-free language where possible
    - Providing multiple perspectives through multi-model consensus
    - Human review for inclusivity and accessibility

  transparency_approach: |
    Full transparency maintained through:
    - Disclosure in front matter (ai_contributor field)
    - Documentation methodology explaining Claude's role
    - Git history showing all AI-assisted contributions
    - This model card documenting capabilities and limitations
