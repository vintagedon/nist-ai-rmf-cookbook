## 5. Conflict Resolution

### 5.1 Internal Disagreements

When Board members disagree on decisions:

1. Discussion: Ensure all perspectives fully heard and understood
2. Evidence: Request additional data, expert input, or operational context
3. Alternatives: Explore compromise positions or phased approaches
4. Vote: If consensus cannot be reached, proceed to majority vote
5. Tiebreaker: CTO breaks ties when Board splits evenly
6. Documentation: Record minority opinions in meeting minutes when significant

### 5.2 Role vs. Board Conflicts

When an individual role decision conflicts with Board direction:

Process:

1. Individual role holder presents rationale for their position
2. Board reconsiders decision with additional context
3. Board affirms, modifies, or reverses original decision
4. Individual implements Board decision or escalates to Executive Leadership
5. If conflict remains unresolved, Executive Leadership makes final determination

Principle: Board decisions override individual role authority within Board's scope, but individuals may appeal to Executive Leadership.

### 5.3 Conflict of Interest

Board members must disclose potential conflicts of interest:

- Financial relationships with AI vendors under evaluation
- Personal use of tools being considered
- External consulting or advisory roles affecting judgment
- Research collaborations creating competing interests

Handling: Member with conflict recuses from vote but may provide informational input if requested by Board.
